"Healthier men, one moustache at a time - Adam Garone",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D4Mmr2E7hM,"  I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon  our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank  you"
Can you solve the famously difficult green-eyed logic puzzle? - Alex Gendler,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98TQv5IAtY8,"Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians, are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There's no escape, except for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes,  they'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed  into the volcano. As it happens,  all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured they can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed  to communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other during each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure  from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them  any new information. What can you say  to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd,  ""At least one of you has green eyes."" The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement couldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island seems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning  after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave the previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount of prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things by imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know,  that could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other  still there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement  could only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes  the same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his or her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning,  they're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see  two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning,  they still can't be sure. Carl thinks, ""If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just  watching each other, and will now both leave  on the second night."" But when he sees both  of them the third morning, he realizes they must  have been watching him, too. Adria and Bill have each  been going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night. Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat no matter how many prisoners you add. The key is the concept  of common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis. The new information was not contained in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone  simultaneously. Now, besides knowing at least one of them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows  that everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them  also knows this, and so on. What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one of the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed as the number of prisoners on the island. Of course, you could have spared the prisoners 98 days on the island by telling them at least 99 of you have green eyes, but when mad dictators are involved, you're best off with a good headstart."
The genius of Mendeleev's periodic table - Lou Serico,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPnwBITSmgU,"Translator: tom carter Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich -- and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, ""eka"" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963. There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back."
What is an aurora? - Michael Molina,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czMh3BnHFHQ,"Every second, one million tons of matter is blasted from the Sun at the velocity of one million miles per hour, and it's on a collision course with Earth! But don't worry, this isn't the opening of a new Michael Bay movie. This is The Journey of the Polar Lights. The northern and southern lights, also known as the aurora Borealis and aurora Australis, respectively, occur when high energy particles from the Sun collide with neutral atoms in our atmosphere. The energy emitted from this crash produces a spectacle of light that mankind has marveled at for centuries. But the particles' journey isn't just as simple as leaving the Sun and arriving at Earth. Like any cross-country road trip, there's a big detour and nobody asks for directions. Let's track this intergalactic voyage by focusing on three main points of their journey: leaving the Sun, making a pit stop in the Earth's magnetic fields, and arriving at the atmosphere above our heads. The protons and electrons creating the northern lights depart from the Sun's corona. The corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere and is one of the hottest regions. Its intense heat causes the Sun's hydrogen and helium atoms to vibrate and shake off protons and electrons as if they were stripping off layers on a hot, sunny day. Impatient and finally behind the wheel, these free protons and electrons move too fast to be contained by the Sun's gravity and group together as plasma, an electrically charged gas. They travel away from the Sun as a constant gale of plasma, known as the solar wind. However, the Earth prevents the solar wind from traveling straight into the planet by setting up a detour, the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is formed by the Earth's magnetic currents and shields our planet from the solar winds by sending out the particles around the Earth. Their opportunity to continue the journey down to the atmosphere comes when the magnetosphere is overwhelmed by a new wave of travelers. This event is coronal mass ejection, and it occurs when the Sun shoots out a massive ball of plasma into the solar wind. When one of these coronal mass ejections collides with Earth, it overpowers the magnetosphere and creates a magnetic storm. The heavy storm stresses the magnetosphere until it suddenly snaps back, like and overstretched elastic band, flinging some of the detoured particles towards Earth. The retracting band of the magnetic field drags them down to the aurora ovals, which are the locations of the northern and southern lights. After traveling 93 million miles across the galaxy, the Sun's particles finally produce their dazzling light show with the help of some friends. 20 to 200 miles above the surface, the electrons and protons meet up with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and they sure are happy to see each other. The Sun's particles high five the atoms, giving their energy to the Earth's neutral oxygen and nitrogen atoms. When the atoms in the atmosphere are contacted by the particles, they get excited and emit photons. Photons are small bursts of energy in the form of light. The colors that appear in the sky depend on the wavelength of the atom's photon. Excited oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colors, whereas excited nitrogen atoms produce blue and deep red hues. The collection of these interactions is what creates the northern and southern lights. The polar lights are best seen on clear nights in regions close to magnetic north and south poles. Nighttime is ideal because the Aurora is much dimmer than sunlight and cannot be seen in daytime. Remember to look up at the sky and read up on the Sun's energy patterns, specifically sunspots and solar flares, as these will be good guides for predicting the auroras."
The sibling rivalry that divided a town - Jay Van Bavel and Dominic Packer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNUQ8RnuUFk,"In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected  their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and  marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became  known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down  to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant  cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn  to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators  at the University of Bristol. This team developed  the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required  to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants  without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic,  gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things correctly or incorrectly; but in reality,  the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources to distribute. Each participant was free to give resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources they personally would receive. With all the ingredients  for discrimination removed and no reason for competition over resources, the scientists assumed this would make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined  by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them” were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes,  resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people  showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel  and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership  to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link  that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have  been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense  of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together  in a new group can temporarily help people overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible."
Animation basics: Homemade special effects - TED-Ed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq-3JfRrgRM,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Jessica Ruby How do you get from point A to point B? Why not spice it up with homemade special effects? A film is simply a series of images played in sequence to create the illusion of motion. If you manipulate those images, crazy things can happen. We used a tablet and one of the many stop motion apps out there. How do you get from point A to point B? We started off by taking a bunch of pictures of Celeste in place. Then, just like stop motion animation, the character is moved just a bit before the next picture is taken, which, in this case, creates a sliding effect. Here we use the oldest trick in the book. By alternating between photos of Celeste on-screen and off-screen, we've made her childhood dream of teleportation a reality. With a little creativity, there are a million ways you can used homemade special effects to make something as simple as getting from point A to point B much more fun. If you're at a loss for ideas, try finding inspiration in your surroundings, like the refrigerator and your coat rack. You can even try incorporating everyday objects from around your house, like, say, umbrellas or binder clips. Wherever there is an object, there is an opportunity to make it come to life. When humans are used in stop motion animation, that's called pixilation, a term coined in the mid-twentieth century, well before the word pixel was a part of our vocabulary. But these sorts of special effects are as old as the art of film making, and thanks to today's technologies, can be reproduced in your very own kitchen. Moving an object from point A to point B is a fundamental principle of animation. To learn more about the process and the tools we used, visit the ""Dig Deeper"" section on ed.ted.com."
What makes a poem … a poem? - Melissa Kovacs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwhouCNq-Fc,"Muhammad Ali spent years training to become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create the shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's  graduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished,  the audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered the shortest poem ever. ""Me, we."" Or is it ""me, weeee""? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem, then what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled with this question, often using metaphors to approximate a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain recognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's musical qualities. This can be achieved through rhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water wrung out of it. Three - poems often feature intense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's ""Ode to an Onion."" Poetry, like art itself, has a way of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns  of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's ""silencio"" toe the line between visual art and poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems whose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness of a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry faded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people love to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets in a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme, rhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. ""I can hear sweat trickling  down your cheek Your heartbeat sound  like Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete."" So far, all the examples we've seen have had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape  that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted updates from the earthquake in Haiti. ""Was in b-room getting dressed when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing."" Smith uses language in a way that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form  that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five,  seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry,  prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis, which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted  through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence  in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed 100% of the time."
What if cracks in concrete could fix themselves? - Congrui Jin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znSeL66e8qE,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life."
Could your language affect your ability to save money? - Keith Chen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUJuYDPXjus, so the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics dating back to at least before adam smith and that is why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior now many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this what i'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save let me tell you a little bit about savings rights a little bit about language and then i'll draw that i'll draw that connection let's start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd or the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd countries by and large you should think about these as the richest most industrialized countries in the world and by joining the oecd they were affirming a common commitment to democracy open markets and free trade despite all of these similarities we see huge differences in savings behavior so all the way over on the left of this graph what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdps per year holding down the right flank of the oecd all the way on the other side is greece and what you can see is that over the last 25 years greece has barely managed to save more than 10 of their gdp it should be noted of course that the united states and the uk are the next in line now that we see these huge differences in savings rights how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ linguist and cognitive scientists have been have been exploring this question for for many years now and then i'll draw the connection between these two behaviors many of you have probably already noticed that i'm chinese i grew up in the uh the midwest of the united states and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and in fact uh more fundamentally than that every so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways now how might that be let me give you an example suppose i were i were talking with you and i was introducing you to my uncle okay you understood exactly what i just said in english if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other though i wouldn't have that luxury all right i wouldn't have been able to convey so little information what my language would have forced me to do instead of just telling you this is my uncle is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth and if this man was my father's brother whether he was older than or younger than my father all of this information is obligatory chinese doesn't let me ignore it and in fact if i want to speak correctly chinese forces me to constantly think about it now uh that fascinated me endlessly as a child but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time so for example if i'm speaking in english i have to speak grammatically differently if i'm talking about past rain it rained yesterday current rain it is raining now or future rain it will rain tomorrow notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events why because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i'm saying to say it will rain it's or it's going to rain it's simply not permissible in english to say it rain tomorrow in contrast to that that's almost exactly what you would say in chinese a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker's ears they can say yesterday it rained now it rain tomorrow would rain in some deep sense chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do uh in order to speak correctly is this difference in languages only between very very distantly related languages like english and chinese actually no so many of you know in this room that english is a germanic language what you may not have realized is that english is actually an outlier it is the only germanic language that requires this for example most other germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying morgan regnetas quite literally to an english ear it rained tomorrow this led me to as a behavioral economist to an intriguing hypothesis could how you speak about time could how your language forces you to think about time affect your propensity to behave across time you speak english a future language and what that means is that every time you discuss the future or any kind of a future event grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly disassociate the future from the present every time you speak if that's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present that's going to make it harder to save if on the other hand you speak a futureless language the present and the future you speak about them identically if that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically that's going to make it easier to save now this is a fanciful theory you know i'm a professor i get paid to have fanciful theories um but how would you actually go about testing such a theory well what i did with n was to access the linguistics literature and and interestingly enough there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world this is a pocket of futureless language speakers in northern europe interestingly enough when you start to crank the data these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be by and large some of the world's best savers just to give you a hint of that let's look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about once you see these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak future languages what is the average difference here five percentage points of your gdp saved per year over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation now while these findings are suggestive countries can be different in so many different ways that it's very very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences what i'm going to show you though is something that i've been engaging in for a year which is trying to gather all of the largest data sets that we have access to our as economists and i'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences hoping to get this relationship to break all right and just in summary no matter how far i push this i can't get it to break let me show you how far you can do that one way to imagine that is i gather large data sets from around the world so for example there's the survey of health and retirement in europe from this data set you actually learn that retired european families are extremely patient with survey takers so so imagine that you're a retired household in belgium someone comes to your front door excuse me uh would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio do you happen to know how much your house is worth you mind telling me would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long if you do would you mind i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway um would you mind squeezing as hard as you can in your dominant hand this device so i can measure your grip strength how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity right this survey takes over a day combine that okay with the demographic and health survey collected by usaid in developing countries in africa for example where which that survey actually can go so far as to measure the directly measure the hiv status of families living in for example rural nigeria combine that with the world value survey which measures the political opinions uh unfortunately for me the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world take all of that data combine it and this map is what you get what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and future languages and what i'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure okay and then i'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels what are the characteristics we can control for well i'm going to match families on country of birth and resonance the demographics what sex their age their income level within their own country their educational achievement a lot about their family structure it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe and most granularly i break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world so an extreme level of granularity uh there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself okay now uh effectively everything i'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families it's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo now even after all of this granular level of control do futureless language speakers seem to save more yes futures language speakers even after this level of control are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year does this have cumulative effects yes by the time they retire futures language speakers holding constant their income are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings can we push this data even further yes because i just told you we actually collect a lot of health data as economists now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings well think about smoking for example smoking is in some deep sense negative savings right if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure smoking is just the opposite it's current pleasure in exchange for future pain what we should expect then is the opposite effect and that's exactly what we find futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families and they're going to be 13 to 70 percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire and they're going to report being 21 more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter i could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find it's almost impossible not to find a a savings behavior for which the this strong effect isn't present my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and uh really explore and understand the ways that these that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak ultimately the goal once we understand how these subtle effects uh can change our decision making we want to be able to kind of provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future thank you very much  you
How you survive the coldest place on Earth - Nadia Frontier,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Mj6wOURSg,"The vast, white ice surface of Antarctica stretches for over 3 million square kilometers: empty, desolate, and almost completely silent. But appearances can be deceiving. On the coast of this expanse, just a few meters beneath the ice lies a multicolored constellation of life. This remarkably diverse realm is home to over 8,000 species of sea denizens who rely on an arsenal of otherworldly traits to survive. So how do these species not only live, but thrive, in conditions most animals would be unable to bear? Antarctic waters are some of the most consistently frigid in the world, hovering below 0 degrees Celsius for a large portion of the year. This means burning energy too quickly can be deadly, so survival in this ecosystem looks slow and steady. Freezing temperatures persist even in the summer, but this season brings a rare gift: sunlight. For a brief period, it’s abundant, shining through the ice for 24 hours a day. This infusion of energy drives intense coastal phytoplankton blooms, transforming the waters into a thick green soup. Marine life both large and small takes advantage of this bounty, including the giant Antarctic isopod. Cousins of the humble pill bug, these crustaceans can reach up to 11 centimeters long, and they never miss the opportunity for a meal. The scavengers eat a wide variety of prey, including other giant isopods. And by slowing their metabolisms, they can make this food last, with one study showing specimens surviving for 50 days without eating. Since this adaptation involves careful conservation of energy, giant isopods spend most of their time stationary or inching across the seafloor. Meanwhile, their tiny amphipod relatives celebrate the summer by releasing offspring alongside the algal explosion, ensuring their young have an abundance of food. And sea cucumbers carpeting the seafloor hoover up the dense plankton with outstretched tentacles, producing nutrient-rich feces that nourish nearby life. But this big summer blowout doesn’t last long. The first signs of autumn arrive in fine needles of frazil ice. These slowly coagulating crystals form a skin across the surface, then mix with falling snow before freezing into a thin crust of ice. The waters get darker and colder. And in this swiftly dimming world, a set of long, spiky limbs sidle into view. With up to six pairs of legs, these giant sea spiders aren’t arachnids, but rather a related class of marine arthropod unique to the seafloor. In addition to housing some of the animal’s organs, its legs are covered in tiny holes, which grow more numerous as the spider ages. These holes will likely help absorb the dissolved oxygen that saturates these freezing southern waters. Since oxygen fuels growth, many local species have evolved to take advantage of this abundance, and it may be one of the reasons that gigantism is so common in this region. Individual sea spiders, for instance, can grow to the size of dinner plates. But soon, these underwater giants will be moving slower than ever. As winter settles in, the sea floor becomes even colder. Waters fall to negative 1.8 degrees Celsius. On the surface, the thin icy crust thickens into a layer called nilas, and young sea ice starts forming ridges that block out the sun. The ocean begins to mirror the still landscape above it. Antarctic sea cucumbers and urchins go into dormancy for months, and their metabolic rates fall to the slowest on Earth. Antarctic limpets continue feeding, but at such a gradual pace that they're largely still surviving on energy reserves from the summer. Tiny crustaceans survive off the traces of algae growing on their home’s icy ceiling, raising their young in these expansive winter nurseries. But this seemingly endless winter won't last forever. As spring comes, light slowly begins to trickle back down through the ice. And week by week, bit by bit, this underwater world will begin waking up to begin its delicate, slow-motion dance once again."
The history of tattoos - Addison Anderson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYn15yDBvxM,"Thinking of getting a tattoo? Decorating your birthday suit would add another personal story to a history of tattoos stretching back at least 8000 years. Tattooed mummies from around the world attest to the universality of body modification across the millennia, and to the fact that you really were stuck with it forever if your civilization never got around to inventing laser removal. A mummy from the Chinchorro culture in pre-Incan Peru has a mustache tattooed on his upper lip. Ötzi, mummified iceman of the Alps, has patterned charcoal tats along his spine, behind his knee  and around his ankles, which might be from an early sort of acupuncture. The mummy of Amunet, a priestess  in Middle Kingdom Egypt, features tattoos thought to symbolize sexuality and fertility. Even older than the mummies, figurines of seemingly tattooed people, and tools possibly used for tattooing date back tens of thousands of years. Tattoos don't have one historical origin point that we know of, but why do we English speakers call them all tattoos? The word is an anglophonic modification of ""tatao,"" a Polynesian word used in Tahiti, where English captain James Cook landed in 1769 and encountered heavily tattooed men and women. Stories of Cook's findings and the tattoos his crew acquired cemented our usage of ""tattoo""  over previous words like ""scarring,"" ""painting,"" and ""staining,"" and sparked a craze in Victorian English high society. We might think of Victorians having Victorian attitudes about such a risque thing, and you can find such sentiments, and even bans, on tattooing throughout history. But while publicly some Brits looked down their noses at tattoos, behind closed doors  and away from their noses, lots of people had them. Reputedly, Queen Victoria had a tiger fighting a python, and tattoos became very popular among Cook's fellow soldiers, who used them to note their travels. You crossed the Atlantic? Get an anchor. Been south of the Equator? Time for your turtle tat. But Westerners sported tattoos  long before meeting the Samoans and Maori  of the South Pacific. Crusaders got the Jerusalem Cross so if they died in battle, they'd get a Christian burial. Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall had military tattoos and called the Picts beyond it ""Picts,"" for the pictures painted on them. There's also a long tradition of people being tattooed unwillingly. Greeks and Romans tattooed slaves and mercenaries to discourage escape and desertion. Criminals in Japan were tattooed as such as far back as the 7th century. Most infamously, the Nazis tattooed numbers on the chest or arms of Jews and other prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify stripped corpses. But tattoos forced on prisoners and outcasts can be redefined as people take ownership of that status or history. Primo Levi survived Auschwitz and wore short sleeves to Germany after the war to remind people of the crime his number represented. Today, some Holocaust  survivors' descendants have their relatives numbers' tattooed on their arms. The Torah has rules against tattoos, but what if you want to make indelible what you feel should never be forgotten? And those criminals and outcasts of Japan, where tattooing was eventually outlawed from the mid-19th century to  just after World War II, added decoration to their penal tattoos, with designs borrowed from woodblock prints, popular literature and mythical spirtual iconography. Yakuza gangs viewed their outsider tattoos as signs of lifelong loyalty and courage. After all, they lasted forever and it really hurt to get them. For the Maori, those tattoos were an accepted mainstream tradition. If you shied away from the excruciating chiseling in of your moko design, your unfinished tattoo marked your cowardice. Today, unless you go the traditional route, your tattoo artist will probably use a tattoo machine based on the one patented by Samuel O'Reilly in 1891, itself based on Thomas Edison's stencil machine from 1876. But with the incredibly broad history of tattoos giving you so many options, what are you going to get? This is a bold-lined expression of who you are, or you want to appear to be. As the naturalist aboard Cook's ship said of the tataoed Tahitians, ""Everyone is marked, thus in different parts of his body, according maybe to his humor or different circumstances of his life."" Maybe your particular humor and circumstances suggest getting a symbol of cultural heritage, a sign of spirituality, sexual energy, or good old-fashioned avant-garde defiance. A reminder of a great accomplishment, or of how you think it would look cool if Hulk Hogan rode a Rhino. It's your expression, your body,  so it's your call. Just two rules: you have to find a tattooist who won't be ashamed to draw your idea, and when in doubt,  you can never go wrong with ""Mom."""
Whoever builds something here will be rich beyond measure - Fabio Pacucci,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGpEbF4aZzs,"Since the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, governments, companies, and research institutions have been planting flags among the stars. But while it might seem like there's plenty of room in this vast expanse, some pieces of celestial real estate are more valuable than others. Each of these dots is a Lagrange point, and as far as human space exploration is concerned, they may be the most important places in our solar system. Named after the 18th century mathematician who deduced their positions, Lagrange points are rare places of equilibrium in our constantly shifting universe. All celestial bodies exert a gravitational force on nearby objects, pulling them in and out of orbits. And gravity acts alongside several apparent forces to determine what those orbits look like. However, Lagrange points are places where all these forces balance out. So if we place a relatively low mass object here, it will maintain a constant distance from the massive bodies pulling on it. Essentially, Lagrange points are celestial parking spaces— once an object is there, it requires little to no energy to stay put. So whenever humans want to keep an object in one place for a long time without using tons of fuel, it needs to be orbiting a Lagrange point. However, there are only so many of these parking spots. Pairs of massive bodies in our solar system generate sets of five Lagrange points. This means our Sun has five points with every planet, and our planets have five points with each of their moons. Adding these up, there are over 1,000 Lagrange points in our solar system— but only a few are useful for human purposes. Many are in locations that are too difficult to reach or simply not very useful. And for reasons we'll explain in a bit, many others are unstable. Currently, only two of these points are heavily used by humans. But we’ll likely use many more in the future— making these limited points exclusive real estate. Which begs the question: what exactly should we park in them? That answer depends on where each point is. Consider the five Lagrange points generated by the Sun and the Earth. L1 is located inside Earth's orbit, about 1.5 million kilometers away from the planet. With this panoramic view of the Sun, unobstructed by Earth’s shadow, L1 is the perfect place for solar-observing satellites. L2 is at the same distance from Earth but outside its orbit and shielded from the Sun, making it the perfect spot to observe outer space. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope went online here, in a spot where the Sun and Earth only occupy a tiny fraction of the sky. L3 is in a particularly mysterious location that can never be directly observed from Earth’s surface. This has made L3 a frequent locale in science fiction, though it hasn’t offered much use to scientists yet. L4 and L5, however, are a bit different from their siblings. In every set of five, the first three Lagrange points are slightly unstable. This means objects will slowly drift away from them, though keeping what we’ve parked there in place is still energetically cheap. The stability of L4 and L5, however, varies from set to set. If the heavier of the two bodies generating the points has less than 25 times the mass of the lighter body, these points are too unstable to park things in. However, if the heavier body is massive enough— like it is in Sun-Earth set— then the relevant forces will always return objects to these equilibrium points, making them our most stable parking spots. That’s why points like these naturally accumulate space objects, such as the Sun-Jupiter set’s L4 and L5, which host thousands of asteroids. Every Lagrange point in our solar system has its quirks. Some might be perfect for scavenging construction materials from drifting asteroids. Others might make ideal gas stations for ships headed to deep space, or even host entire human colonies. These points are already home to advanced technological achievements, but soon, they could become our stepping stones to the stars."
Is capitalism actually broken?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcR815SfWOU,"Each one of these machines represents the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff  that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay  for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls  who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns  every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably  the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%, private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here,  at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control  the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination,  like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies with no markets, where the government sets all prices, and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set  the price of everything, even things like basic  life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods  to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height  of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close  to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes, both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended  up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States,  food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal, but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry,  and in 1906, Congress passed  the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage  for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality, can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand  for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied  the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied  or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland,  and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have the best data before capitalism, the share of income going to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up—  hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point:  in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism,  while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems,  is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say  that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come  other benefits: education, health, social standing, and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically,  an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes, broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant, since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much  of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver of climate change and in many places is contributing to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is:  can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down and build a new one from scratch?"
Can you solve the counterfeit coin riddle? - Jennifer Lu,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE2dZLDJSjA,"You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician, but ever since you criticized the emperor's tax laws, you’ve been locked in the dungeon  with only a marker to count the days. But one day you're suddenly brought before the emperor, who looks even angrier than usual. One of his 12 governors has been convicted of paying his taxes with a counterfeit coin, which has already made its way  into the Treasury. As the kingdom's greatest mathematician, you’ve been granted a chance to earn  your freedom by identifying the fake. Before you are the 12 identical looking coins and a balance scale. You know that the false coin will be very slightly lighter or heavier than the rest. But the emperor’s not a patient man. You may only use the scale three times before you’ll be thrown  back into the dungeon. You look around for anything else you can use, but there's nothing in the room, just the coins, the scale, and your trusty marker. How do you identify the counterfeit? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Obviously, you can't weigh each coin against all of the others, so you’ll have to weigh several coins at the same time by splitting the stack  into multiple piles, then narrowing down where the false coin is. Start by dividing the 12 coins  into three equal piles of four. Placing two of these on the scale gives us two possible outcomes. If the two sides balance,  all eight coins on the scale are real and the fake must be among  the remaining four. So how do you keep track of these results? That’s where the marker comes in. Mark the eight authentic coins with a zero. Now take three of them and weigh them against three unmarked coins. If they balance, the remaining unmarked coin must be the fake. If they don’t, draw a plus  on the three unmarked coins if they’re heavier,  or a minus if they’re lighter. Now take two of the newly marked coins and weigh them against each other. If they balance, the third coin is fake. Otherwise, look at their marks. If they are plus coins,  the heavier one is the impostor. If they are marked with minus, it's the lighter one. But what if the first two piles you way don't balance? Mark the coins on the heavier side with a plus and those on the lighter side  with a minus. You can also mark the remaining four coins with zeros, since you know the fake one  is already somewhere on the scale. Now you'll need to think strategically so you can remove all remaining ambiguity in just two more ways. To do this, you’ll need  to reassemble the piles. One method is to replace three  of the plus coins with three of the minus coins and replace those with three of the zero coins. From here, you have three possibilities. If the previously heavier side  of the scale is still heavier, that means either the remaining  plus coin on that side is actually the heavier one, or the remaining minus coin on the  lighter side is actually the lighter one. Choose either one of them and weigh it  against one of the regular coins to see which is true. If the previously heavier side  became lighter, that means one of the three minus coins you moved is actually the lighter one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third is counterfeit. If not, the lighter one is. Similarly, if the two sides balanced after your substitution, then one of the three plus coins  you removed must be the heavier one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third one is fake. If not, then it's the heavier one. The emperor nods approvingly at your finding, and the counterfeiting lord  takes your place in the dungeon."
"Conserving our spectacular, vulnerable coral reefs - Joshua Drew",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPmlD6demPk,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Coral reefs are some of the most spectacular ecosystems on the planet. They're also some of the most vulnerable. But how can we protect the reefs and the animals and plants who rely on them? And how can we make sure our protected areas aren't hurting those who use reefs to survive? These are some of the big questions facing marine conservation biologists today. Let's take Fiji, for example. Fiji is series of islands in the South Pacific Ocean. To help balance the need for conservation and making a living, scientists had suggested that instead of one big park which provides a lot of coverage for one reef system while leaving the rest unprotected, a better way is to create a system of protected areas nested together like pearls on a string. This idea is called connectivity. In this way, scientists can protect lots of different habitats while not excluding people from their traditional fishing grounds. Now, the only way this string-of-pearls kind of reserve network is going to work is if each park is connected to other parks. There are two main benefits to this. First of all, insurance. If something bad happens to one park, say, an oil spill or coral bleaching, then because that park is part of a system, it can be reseeded from other parks that escaped the event. The second benefit is representation. By conserving many different areas, scientists ensure that lots of different habitats get protected. This way, they can make sure all the different marine habitats in Fiji, such as coral reefs, mangroves, and sea-grass beds, are all represented. This way, we don't unduly settle any particular village or group of people with the economic burden of having their fishing grounds off-limits. By sharing the cost around the communities, they can also share the benefits. So if we agree that rather than one big park, we should have lots of parks of different sizes and covering different habitats, then scientists need to make sure those smaller parks are connected, because if they're not, they probably won't be self-sustaining. But how do we know that? That's where genetics and DNA come in. By looking at how closely related the fish in each one of these small reserves in Fiji are to each other, scientists can figure out how much migration is going on among the reserves within the system. Now it's important to look at a variety of different species because there's no guarantee that what's going on with these guys is what's going on with these guys. But if we look closely and at enough species, we can see whether or not the necklace is working. What scientists have found so far is that, in general, there's a fair amount of connectivity amongst the parks within Fiji. But it's not just a big free-for-all; rather, it seems that, for some species, babies born in the far west are having a hard time making it to the islands in the far east. To help deal with that, conservation biologists are suggesting that there be enough parks in both the east and the west to keep the populations healthy. This isn't just in Fiji, either. Lessons about reserve connectivity can help across the world. In places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Bahamas, scientists are using a variety of tools to help understand how individual parks can function together, so that their sum is greater than their whole. And this way, we can keep the beautiful necklace that is our coral reefs, intact."
ET is (probably) out there -- get ready - Seth Shostak,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0m8WdR1FcQ,"was easy out there well I work at the SETI Institute that's almost my name SETI search for extraterrestrial intelligence in other words I look for aliens and when I tell people that at a cocktail party they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate now a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic ridiculous maybe even hopeless but I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think that the job I have is actually a privilege okay and give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into this line of work if that's what you call it this thing whoops can we go back hello come in earth there we go alright now this is the Owens Valley radio Observatory behind this year in Nevada's and in 1968 I was working there collecting data for my thesis now it's kind of lonely it's kind of tedious is collecting data so I would amuse myself by taking photos at night of the telescope's or even of myself because you know it at night I would be the only hominid within about 30 miles so here are pictures of myself the observatory had just acquired a new book written by a Russian cosmologists by the name of Joseph Schillaci and then expanded and translated and edited by a little-known Cornell astronomer by name of Carl Sagan and I remember reading that book and at 3:00 in the morning of reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas I was using to measure the dispense of galaxies could also be used to communicate to send bits of information from one star system to another now three o'clock in the morning when you're all alone haven't had much sleep that was a very romantic idea but it was that idea the fact that you could in fact prove that there's somebody out there just using the same technology that appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job at the SETI Institute now I have to say that my memory is notoriously porous and I've often wondered whether there was any truth in this story it was just you know miss remembering something but I recently just blew up this old negative of mine and sure enough there you can see the Schloss key and sagan book under that analog calculating device so it's true all right now the idea for doing this it wasn't very old at the time that I made that photo the idea dates from 1961 a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on et now Frank didn't hear anything actually he did but it turned out to be the US Air Force which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence but Drake's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing I'll get back to that and on the basis of this experiment which you didn't didn't succeed we have been doing study ever since not continuously but ever since we still haven't heard anything we still haven't heard anything in fact we don't know about any life beyond Earth but I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change rather soon and the part of the reason in fact the majority of the reason why I think that's going to change it's that the equipment's getting better this is the Allen telescope array about 350 miles from whatever seat you're in right now this is something that we're using today to search for et and the electronics have gotten very much better - this is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960 this is the Allen telescope array electronics today some pundit with too much time on his hands has reckoned that the new experiments are approximately a hundred trillion times better than they were in 1960 hundred trillion times better that's a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card okay but something that's not appreciated by the public is in fact that the experiment continues to get better and consequently tends to get faster this little plot and every time you show a plot you lose ten percent of the audience I have 12 of these but whatever what I plotted here is just some metric that shows how fast we're searching in other words we're looking for a needle in a haystack we know how big the haystack is it's the galaxy but we're going through the haystack no longer with the teaspoon but with a skip loader because of this increase in speed in fact those of you who are still conscious and mathematically you know competent will note that this is a semi-log plot in other words the rate of increase is exponential it's exponentially improving now exponential is an overworked word you hear it on the media all the time they don't really know what exponential means but this is exponential in fact it's doubling every 18 months and of course every card-carrying member of the digerati knows that that's Moore's law so this means that over the course of the next 2,000 years we'll be able to look at a million star systems a million star systems looking for signals that would prove somebody's out there well a million star systems is that interesting I mean how many of those star systems have planets and in fact sorry we didn't know the answer to that even as recently as fifteen years ago and in fact we really didn't know it even as recently as six months ago but now we do recent results suggest that virtually every star has planets and more than one they're like you know kittens you get no you get a litter you don't get one kitten you get a bunch okay so in fact this is a pretty accurate estimate of the number of planets in our galaxy just in our galaxy okay and I remind the non astronomy majors among you that our galaxy is only one of a hundred billion that we can see with our telescopes that's a lot of real estate but of course most of these planets are going to be kind of worthless like you know mercury or Neptune Neptune is probably not very big in your life okay so the question is what fraction of these planets are actually suitable for life we don't know the answer to that either but we will learn that answer this year thanks to the NASA's Kepler space telescope and in fact the smart money which is to say the people who work on this project the smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets that might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand one in a hundred something like that well even taking the the pessimistic estimate that it's one in a thousand that means that there are at least a billion cousins of the earth just in our own galaxy okay now I've given you a lot of numbers here but they're mostly big numbers okay so you know keep that in mind there's plenty of real estate plenty of real estate in the universe and if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's some interesting occupants that makes you a miracle I know you like to think you're a miracle but if you do science you learn rather quickly that every time you think you're a miracle you're wrong so probably not the case all right so the bottom line is this because of the increase in speed and because of the vast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos I figure we're gonna pick up a signal within two dozen years and I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you either we're gonna find et in the next two dozen years or I'll buy you a cup of coffee okay so that's not so bad I mean even with two dozen years you open up your brows and there's news of a signal or you know you get a cup of coffee now let me tell you about some aspect of this that people don't think about and that is what what happens suppose that you know the what I say is true I mean who knows but suppose it happens suppose sometime in the next two dozen years we pick up a faint line that tells us we have some cosmic company what is the effect what's the consequence now I might be at ground zero for this I happen to know what the consequence for me would be because we've had false alarms this is 1997 it's a photo I made it about three o'clock in the morning in Mountain View here when we were watching the computer monitors because we picked up a signal that we thought this is the real deal all right and I kept waiting for the men in black to show up right I kept waiting for yeah I kept waiting for my mom to call somebody to call the government to call nobody called nobody called I was so nervous that I couldn't sit down I just wandered around taking photos like this one just for something to do well at 9:30 in the morning with my head down on my desk cause it obviously hadn't slept all night the phone rings and it's the New York Times and I think there's a lesson in that and that lesson is that if we pick up the signal the media the media will be on it faster than a weasel on ball bearings it's gonna be fast okay you can be sure that no secrecy okay that's what happens to me it kind of ruins my whole whole week because whatever I've got planned that week kind of out the window but what about you what's it gonna do to you and the answer is we don't know the answer we don't know what that's gonna do to you're not in the long term and not even very much in the short term I mean that would be a bit like asking Chris Columbus in 1491 hey Chris you know what happens if it turns out that there's a continent between here and Japan where you're sailing to what will be the consequences for Humanity if that turns out to be the case I think Chris probably would offer you some some answer that you might not have understood but it probably wouldn't have been right and I think that to predict what finding et is going to mean we can't predict that either but here a couple of things I can say to begin with it's going to be a society that's away in advance of our own you're not gonna hear from alien Neanderthals they're not building transmitters they're gonna be ahead of us maybe by a few thousand years maybe by a few million years but substantially ahead of us and that means if you can understand anything that they're going to say then you might be able to short-circuit history by getting information from a society that's way beyond our own now you might find out a bit hyperbolic and maybe it is but nonetheless it's conceivable that this will happen in you know you could consider this like I don't know giving Julius Caesar English lessons in the key to the Library of Congress it would change his day all right that's one thing another thing that's for sure going to happen is that it will calibrate us we will know that we're not that miracle right there were just another duck in a row we're not the only kids on the block and I think that that's philosophically a very profound thing to learn we're not a miracle okay the third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague but I think interesting and important and that is if you find a signal coming from a more advanced society because they will be that will tell you something about our own possibilities that we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction because they survived their technology we could do it too normally when you look out into the universe you're looking back in time right that's that's interesting to cosmologists but in this sense you actually can look into the future hazily but you can look into the future so those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection now let me talk a little bit about something that happens even in the meantime and that is SETI I think is important because it's exploration and it's not only exploration its comprehensible exploration now I gotta tell you I'm I'm you know always reading books about explorers I find exploration very interesting Arctic exploration you know people like Magellan almonds and Shackleton you see Franklin down there Scott all these guys it's really nifty exploration they're just doing it because they want to explore it and you might say oh that's kind of a frivolous opportunity but that's not frivolous that's not a frivolous activity because let me think of ants you know most ants are programmed to follow one another along enough in a long line but they're couple ants maybe 1% of those ants that are what they call pioneer ants and they're the ones that wander off they're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop you get got to get them with your thumb before they find their sugar or something okay but those ants even though most of them get wiped out those ants are the ones that are essential to the survival of the hive so exploration is important I also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address what I think is a critical lack in our society and that's the lack of science literacy the lack of the ability to even understand science now look a lot has been written about the you know the plural state of science literacy in this country right you've heard about it well here's one example in fact polls taken this is this poll was taken 10 years ago it shows like I'm roughly 1/3 of the public thinks that the aliens are not only out there we're looking for them out there but they're here right sailing the skies and their saucers and occasionally abducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of well that would be interesting if it was true in job security for me but I don't think the evidence is very good that's more you know sad and significant but there are other things that people believe that are significant like the efficacy of homeopathy or that evolution is just you know sort of a crazy idea by scientists without any legs or you know evolution they all that sort of thing our global warming these sorts of ideas don't really have any validity that you can't trust the scientists now we got to solve that problem because that's a critically important problem and you you you might say well ok how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI well let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem but it can address the problem it can address the problem by getting young people interested in science look science is hard it has a reputation of being hard and the facts are it is hard and that's the result of 400 years of science right I mean in the 18th century in the 18th century you could become an expert on any field of science in an afternoon by going to a library if you could find a library right in the 19th century if you had a basement lab you could make major scientific discoveries in your own home right because it was all this science just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up well that's not true anymore today you got to spend years in grad school in postdoc positions just to figure out what the important questions are it's hard there's no doubt about it and in fact here's an example the Higgs boson finding the Higgs boson ask the next 10 people you see on the streets hey do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson I bet the answer you're gonna get is well I don't know what the Higgs boson is and I don't know if it's important and probably most of the people wouldn't even know the value of a Swiss franc okay and yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem okay so that doesn't get people interest in science because they can't comprehend what it's about SETI on the other hand is really simple we're gonna use these big antennas we're gonna try and eavesdrop on signals everybody can understand that yes technologically it's very sophisticated but everybody gets the idea so that's one thing the other thing is it's exciting science it's exciting because we're naturally interested in other intelligent beings and I think that's part of our hardwiring I mean we're hardwired to be interested in beings that might be if you will competitors or if you're the romantic sort possibly even mates okay this is analogous to our interest in things that have big teeth right very interesting things that have big teeth you can see the evolutionary value of that and you can also see the practical consequences by watching watching Animal Planet you notice they make they make very few programs about gerbils it's mostly about things that have big teeth okay so we're interested in these sorts of things right and not just us it's it's it's also kids this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science because SETI involves all kinds of science obviously biology obviously astronomy but also geology also chemistry various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of we're looking for et so to me this is this is interesting and important and in fact it's my policy even though I give a lot of talks to adults you give talks to adults in two days later they're back where they were but if you give talks to kids you know one in 50 of them some light bulb goes off and and I think gee I'd never thought that and then think oh you know read a book or a magazine or whatever they get interested in something now it's my theory supported only by anecdotal personal anecdotal evidence but nonetheless that kids get interested in something between the ages of 8 and 11 you got to get him there so alright give talks adults that's fine but I try and make 10% of the talks that I give try and make those four kids okay I remember when a guy came to our high school actually Rose actually my junior high school I was in sixth grade and he gave some talk all I remember from it was one word electronics there's like Dustin Hoffman in the Graduate right when he said plastics whatever that means plastics all right I think I sell electronics I don't remember anything else in fact I don't remember anything that my sixth grade teacher said all year but I remember electronics and so I got interested in electronics and you know I got a study to get my hand why since I was wiring up stuff here I am at about 15 or something doing that sort of stuff okay that had a big effect on me so that's my point that you can have a big effect on these kids in fact this reminds me I don't know a couple years ago I gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto where there were about a dozen 11 year olds that come to this talk I've been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour 11-year olds they're all sitting in a little semicircle looking up at me with big eyes and I started there was a whiteboard behind me and I started off by writing a one with 22 zeros after it and I said I'd now look the number of stars in the visible universe and this number is so big there's not even a name for it okay and one of these kids shot up his hand and he said watch e there is a name for it it's a sex toy a Quadro Hexter something or other right now that kid was wrong by four or four orders of magnitude but there was no doubt about it these kids were smart okay so I stopped giving the lecture all they wanted to do was ask questions in fact my my last comments to these kids at the end I said you know you kids are smarter than the people I work with now they didn't even care about that what they wanted what they wanted was my email address so they could ask me more questions so let me just say look my job is a privilege because we're in a special time previous generations couldn't do this experiment at all right in another generation down the line I think we will have succeeded so to me it is a privilege and when I look in the mirror you know the facts are that I really don't see myself what I see is the generation behind me these are some kids from the Huff School fourth graders talk there what two weeks ago something like that I think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works well that's a payoff beyond easy measure thank you very much"
This one weird trick will help you spot clickbait - Jeff Leek & Lucy McGowan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IzfzoZsa-Q,"One simple vitamin can reduce  your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces  stress in students. New drug prolongs lives of  patients with rare disease. Health headlines like these  are published every day, sometimes making opposite claims  from each other. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines  and the often specific, incremental results of the medical  research they cover. So how can you avoid being  misled by grabby headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s  credibility is to look at the original  research it reports on. We’ve come up with a hypothetical research scenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation of the first example; then pause at the headline to  answer the question. These are simplified scenarios. A real study would detail many more  factors and how it accounted for them, but for the purposes of this exercise, assume all the information  you need is included. Let’s start by considering the  cardiovascular effects of a certain vitamin, Healthium. The study finds that participants taking Healthium had a higher level of healthy cholesterol  than those taking a placebo. Their levels became similar to those of  people with naturally high levels of this kind of cholesterol. Previous research has shown that people  with naturally high levels of healthy cholesterol have lower  rates of heart disease. So what makes this headline misleading: ""Healthium reduces risk of heart disease."" The problem with this headline is that the research didn’t actually investigate whether Healthium reduces heart disease. It only measured Healthium’s impact on levels of a particular  kind of cholesterol. The fact that people with naturally high levels of that cholesterol have lower risk of heart attacks doesn’t mean that the same  will be true of people who elevate their cholesterol levels using Healthium. Now that you’ve cracked the  case of Healthium, try your hand at a particularly alluring  mystery: the relationship between eating chocolate and stress. This hypothetical study  recruits ten students. Half begin consuming a  daily dose of chocolate, while half abstain. As classmates, they all follow  the same schedule. By the end of the study, the chocolate  eaters are less stressed than their chocolate-free counterparts. What’s wrong with this headline: ""Eating chocolate reduces  stress in students"" It’s a stretch to draw a conclusion about  students in general from a sample of ten. That’s because the fewer participants are in a random sample, the less likely it is that the sample will closely represent the target population as a whole. For example, if the broader population of  students is half male and half female, the chance of drawing a sample of 10 that’s skewed 70% male and  30% is about 12%. In a sample of 100 that would be less than a .0025% chance, and for a sample of 1000, the odds are less than 6 x 10^-36. Similarly, with fewer participants, each individual’s outcome has a larger  impact on the overall results— and can therefore skew big-picture trends. Still, there are a lot of good reasons for scientists to run small studies. By starting with a small sample, they can evaluate whether the results are  promising enough to run a more comprehensive,  expensive study. And some research requires very specific participants that may be impossible to  recruit in large numbers. The key is reproducibility— if an article draws a conclusion  from one small study, that conclusion may be suspect— but if it’s based on many studies  that have found similar results, it’s more credible. We’ve still got one more puzzle. In this scenario, a study tests a new drug for a rare, fatal disease. In a sample of 2,000 patients, the ones who start taking the drug upon  diagnosis live longer than those who  take the placebo. This time, the question  is slightly different. What’s one more thing you’d like to know  before deciding if the headline, ""New drug prolongs lives of patients with rare disease"", is justified? Before making this call, you’d want to know how much the drug  prolonged the patients’ lives. Sometimes, a study can have results that, while scientifically valid, don’t have  much bearing on real world outcomes. For example, one real-life clinical trial  of a pancreatic cancer drug found an increase in life expectancy— of ten days. The next time you see a surprising medical headline, take a look at the science  it’s reporting on. Even when full papers aren’t  available without a fee, you can often find summaries of  experimental design and results in freely available abstracts, or even within the text  of a news article. It’s exciting to see scientific research  covered in the news, and important to understand  the studies’ findings."
Why Shakespeare loved iambic pentameter - David T. Freeman and Gregory Taylor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5lsuyUNu_4,"To someone first encountering the works of William Shakespeare, the language may seem strange. But there is a secret to appreciating it. Although he was famous for his plays, Shakespeare was first and foremost a poet. One of the most important things  in Shakespeare's language is his use of stress. Not that kind of stress, but the way we emphasize certain  syllables in words more than others. We're so used to doing this that we may not notice it at first. But if you say the word slowly, you can easily identify them. Playwright, computer, telephone. Poets are very aware of these stresses, having long experimented with the number and order of stressed  and unstressed syllables, and combined them in different ways to create rhythm in their poems. Like songwriters, poets often express their ideas through  a recognizable repetition of these rhythms or poetic meter. And like music, poetry has its own set of terms  for describing this. In a line of verse, a foot is a certain number  of stressed and unstressed syllables forming a distinct unit, just as a musical measure consists of a certain number of beats. One line of verse is usually made up of several feet. For example, a dactyl is a metrical  foot of three syllables with the first stressed, and the second and third unstressed. Dactyls can create lines that move swiftly and gather force, as in Robert Browning's poem,  ""The Lost Leader."" ""Just for a handful of silver he left us. Just for a rib and to stick in his coat."" Another kind of foot  is the two-syllable long trochee, a stressed syllable  followed by an unstressed one. The trochees in these lines  from Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" lend an ominous and spooky tone to the witches' chant. ""Double, double, toil and trouble; fire burn and cauldron bubble."" But with Shakespeare, it's all about the iamb. This two-syllable foot  is like a reverse trochee, so the first syllable is unstressed and the second is stressed, as in, ""To be, or not to be."" Shakespeare's favorite meter,  in particular, was iambic pentameter, where each line of verse is made up of five two-syllable iambs, for a total of ten syllables. And it's used for many  of Shakespeare's most famous lines: ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"" ""Arise fair sun,  and kill the envious moon."" Notice how the iambs cut across both punctuation and word separation. Meter is all about sound, not spelling. Iambic pentameter may sound technical, but there's an easy way  to remember what it means. The word iamb is pronounced just like the phrase, ""I am."" Now, let's expand that to a sentence that just happens  to be in iambic pentameter. ""I am a pirate with a wooden leg."" The pirate can only walk in iambs, a living reminder  of Shakespeare's favorite meter. Iambic pentameter  is when he takes ten steps. Our pirate friend can even help us  remember how to properly mark it if we image the footprints he leaves walking along a deserted island beach: A curve for unstressed syllables, and a shoe outline for stressed ones. ""If music be the food of love, play on."" Of course, most lines  of Shakespeare's plays are written in regular prose. But if you read carefully, you'll notice that Shakespeare's  characters turn to poetry, and iambic pentameter in particular, for many of the same reasons  that we look to poetry in our own lives. Feeling passionate, introspective, or momentous. Whether it's Hamlet pondering  his existence, or Romeo professing his love, the characters switch to iambic pentameter when speaking about their emotions and their place in the world. Which leaves just one last question. Why did Shakespeare choose  iambic pentameter for these moments, rather than, say, trochaic hexameter or dactylic tetrameter? It's been said that iambic pentameter  was easy for his actors to memorize and for the audience to understand because it's naturally suited  to the English language. But there might be another reason. The next time you're in a heightened  emotional situation, like the ones that make  Shakespeare's characters burst into verse, put your hand over  the left side of your chest. What do you feel? That's your heart beating in iambs. Da duhm, da duhm,  da duhm, da duhm, da duhm. Shakespeare's most poetic lines don't just talk about matters of the heart. They follow its rhythm."
How much land does it take to power the world?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW0jTe80kmM,"No matter how we make electricity, it takes up space. Electricity from coal requires mines, and plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines, facilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store  the spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines  or solar panels. How much space depends on the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt  light bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce  up to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized chunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only need an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least 0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly 7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space—  to power the bulb. When you consider the space needed  to power cities, countries, and the whole world, it adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts  of electricity. To power the entire world  with only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200 square kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost four times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers,  a little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least 95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million— about the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability in how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general sense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure in a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean  are completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space  they occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out— sometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency  of the others. So, much of the land needed  to generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space still matters, because cities and other densely populated areas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure  works best when electricity is generated where and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent across long distances. Still, space demands are only part of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity comes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation  is responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons  of greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change  and all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least space of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases and don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build than solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered  by fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel  to generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places  than others. No single approach will be the best option to power the entire world while eliminating harmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power might be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S.,  have the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity  from renewables. And across the board, we should be working to make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport  in the case of renewables."
How (and why) to read William Faulkner  - Sascha Morrell,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYQWh8VGL3M,"You’re halfway through what’s supposedly one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, but nothing quite makes sense. Narrating characters offer clashing versions of the same story and often seem unsure who, what, or when they’re talking about. Seemingly minor details trigger intense emotional reactions you don't understand. And the prose is loaded with convoluted sentences and outlandish imagery. Confused? Good— that means you’re on the right track. William Faulkner is considered one of America’s most remarkable and perplexing writers. Fortunately, he wasn’t just toying with his audience. Faulkner used confusion intentionally, to explore the most mysterious parts of the human mind and investigate pressing issues of personal, racial, and regional identity. The result is a body of work that’s shocking, inventive, and often hilarious— but above all, challenging. So what clues should readers look for to navigate his literary labyrinths? Many of Faulkner’s novels are set in the fictional county of Yoknapatawpha— a fantastical reimagining  of Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. Born in 1897, Faulkner grew up steeped in oral storytelling traditions, from folklore and family histories to local legends of Civil War glory. However, these grand myths didn’t match the messy reality of the American South, divided by racist Jim Crow laws and plagued by the legacies of slavery and colonial violence. All these tensions come alive  inside Yoknapatawpha. Full of horror, humor, and human tragedy, Faulkner’s stories feature  many memorable characters, like the spurned bride who sleeps beside her would-be husband’s corpse, or the duped sharecropper obsessively hunting for imaginary coins. At first glance, these characters seem grotesquely absurd. But under the surface,  they all reflect his obsession with how people process the past— what they stubbornly hold on to, unwittingly forget and willingly distort. Much of Faulkner’s fiction is told from multiple perspectives, offering the reader several versions of the story’s events. For example, “The Sound and the Fury” combines the narratives of Benjy, Quentin, and Jason Compson, three brothers haunted by memories of their sister Caddy. One brother's narration will occasionally fill the gaps left by another's, but just as often, their accounts contradict each other. To make things more confusing,  Benjy’s narration is disjointed in time, slipping between past and present without warning. Meanwhile, Quentin's section confuses fact and fantasy as it jumps backward in time from the day of his untimely death. Only the aggressive, money-hungry Jason attempts to embrace the present— but even he is constantly overtaken by past resentments. Following these threads can be bewildering, but Faulkner wants the audience to share in the characters’ confusion. This approach allows readers to understand the Compsons’ biases and blindspots firsthand. And since his characters’ distortions of the past often reflect larger denials of Southern history, it also allows Faulkner to explore  his own anxieties about the South. For example, his novel “Light in August” deliberately induces ambiguity about a character’s racial origins in ways that undermine rigid Jim Crow policies. And in “Absalom, Absalom!” narrating townsfolk remark that “no one knew how” a local landowner had come into his property, and that his house was built “apparently out of nothing.” This kind of evasive language shows how characters are desperate to cover up the region's intolerable history of genocide and slavery. But even when exploring the heaviest topics, Faulkner spellbinds readers with verbal acrobatics. One particularly bewildering sentence in “Absalom, Absalom!” runs 1,288 words long, and features locals haggling over “violently-colored candy,” a “cloudy swirl of chickens,” and a hard-drinking planter who’s compared to both  a worn-out cannon and a showgirl. Even his jokes can breed more confusion, such as when Benjy Compson conflates his sister Caddy with golf caddies. Reading Faulkner is rarely easy, but it is deeply rewarding. He invites readers to contemplate the unreliable nature of history and memory. And in teaching us to embrace confusion and recognize the limits  of our perception, Faulkner can help us listen  for hidden meanings in the sound and fury that surround us."
A plane you can drive - Anna Mracek Dietrich,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAeIeYLlvTU,what is it about flying cars we've wanted to do this for about a hundred years and there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success but we haven't yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really truly seeing lessly integrates the two-dimensional world that were comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us that I don't know about you but I really enjoy spending time in we looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren't available previously we have modern composite materials we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power-to-weight ratios that have ever been available we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly directly to you in the cockpit but without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective we realized that we were going to be getting the same result that people had been getting for the last hundred years which isn't where we want to be right now so instead of trying to make a car that can fly we decided to try to make a plane that could drive and the result is the Terrafugia transition it's a two-seat single-engine airplane that works just like any other smaller plane you take off and land at a local airport then once you're on the ground you fold up the wings drive it home park it in your garage and it works after two years of an iterative design and construction process the proof-of-concept made its public debut in 2008 now like with anything that's really different from the status quo it didn't always go so well testing that aircraft and we discovered that it's a very good thing that when you go home with something that's been broken you've actually learned a lot more than when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives the first time through so we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we'd all helped build in the air off the ground like it was supposed to be and on our third high-speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York we got to do that for the first time the picture behind me was stopped by the copilot in our chase aircraft just moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time and we were all very flattered to see that image become a symbol of accomplishing something that people had thought was impossible really the world over the flight testing that followed that was as basic and low-risk as we could make it but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market the general aviation community and with the regulator's that govern the use and design of aircraft is particularly in the States the FAA about a year ago gave us an exemption for the transition till allow us to have an additional 110 pounds within the light sport aircraft category now that doesn't sound like a lot but it's very important because being able to deliver the transition as a light-sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it a sport pilot can be certificated in as little as 20 hours of flight time and at 110 pounds that's very important for solving the other side of the equation driving it turns out that driving with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles is actually a harder problem to solve than flying for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground this may be counterintuitive but driving has potholes cobblestones pedestrians other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with fortunately necessity remains the mother of invention and a lot of the design work that were the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground everything from a continuously variable transmission and liquid based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine and stop and go traffic to a custom-designed gearbox that power is either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground to the automated wing folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment - crash safety features we have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car now this also as good as it is wasn't quite enough the regulations for vehicles on the road were written with an airplane in mind so we did need a little bit of support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration you may have seen in the news recently they came through with us at the end of last month with a few special exemptions that will allow the transition to be sold in the same category as SUVs and light trucks as a multi-purpose passenger vehicle it is now officially quote designed for occasional off-road use now let's see it in action you can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane you're not powering the propeller you're powering the wheels and it is under 7 feet tall so it will fit in a standard construction garage and that's the automated wing folding mechanism that's real time you just push a few buttons in the cockpit and the wings come out once they're fully deployed there's a mechanical lock that goes into place again from inside the cockpit and they're now fully capable of handling any of the loads that you would see in a flight just like putting on your convertible top and you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that right until the vehicle flies you know 75% of your risk is that first one we were all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop and our test pilot gave us the best feedback that you can get from a test pilot after a first flight which was that it was remarkably unremarkable he would go on to tell us that the transition had been the easiest airplane to land that he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot so despite making something that is seemingly revolutionary we really focus on doing as little knew as possible we leverage a lot of Technology from the state of the art in general aviation and from automotive racing when we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box we use an incremental design build test redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk and baby steps now since we started Terrafugia about six years ago we've had a lot of those baby steps we've gone from being three of us working in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school to about two dozen of us working in an initial production facility outside of Boston we've had to overcome challenges like keeping the weight below the lights for at limits that I talked about figuring out how to politely respond when a regulator tells you but that won't fit through a tollbooth with the wings extended to all of the other associated durability and engineering issues that we talked about on the ground still if everything goes to our satisfaction with the testing and construction of the the to production prototypes that we're working on right now those first deliveries to are about a hundred people that have reserved an airplane at this point should begin at the end of next year the transition will cost in line with other small airplanes and I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy but I do think that the transition should be your next airplane here's why while nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world goes through a relatively small number of large hub airports there is a huge underutilized resource out there there are thousands of local air strips that don't seem nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could on average there's one Duke within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the United States the transition gives you a safer more convenient and more fun way of using this resource for those of you who aren't yet pilots there's four main reasons why those of us who are don't fly as much as we'd like to there whether primarily cost long door-to-door travel time eye mobility your destination now bad weather comes in just land fold up the wings drive home it doesn't matter if it rains a little you have a windshield wiper instead of paying to keep your airplane and a hangar parking in your garage and the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional lab gas door-to-door travel time is reduced because now instead of lugging bags finding a parking space taking off your shoes or pulling your plane out of the hangar you're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go and mobility at your destination is clearly solved just fold up the wings and keep going the transition simultaneously expands our horizons while making the world a smaller more accessible place it also continues to be a fabulous adventure I hope that you'll need to take a moment to think about how you could use something like this to give yourself more access to your own world and to make your own travel more convenient and more fun thank you for giving me the opportunity to share it with you
Can you solve the Big Bang riddle? - James Tanton,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEDabz-hyKo,"It’s moments after the Big Bang and... wow, you’re still reeling. You’re a particle of matter,  amidst a chaotic stew of forces, fusion, and annihilation. If you’re lucky and avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles that have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter  and antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle  of antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle to—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten  to make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat  until just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you, as with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose  where to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure you’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want  to figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing what the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end:  with you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also  some matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations  in any circle by marking all pairs  of adjacent particles, then the newly adjacent pairs, and so on, to reach this final set. If you map them back  to the original circle, standing to the immediate left  of those final matter particles or the immediate right  of final antiparticles means you’ll reach this endgame state  and survive. So here are the safe spots  in all three given circles. You find a good position and experience the bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off and becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter amidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy  send emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed  you’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter  and a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen  to represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter  and antimatter cubes in a ring. Your job: pick a spot to stand  where you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate annihilations like before, but you have a programmable device you can point at spots between cubes. The device can detect the full sequence of cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type, perform arithmetic, and carry out simple logical commands. How do you program your device  to identify safe spots? Pause to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards  starting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs nestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next, each adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll  of fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube because only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends  on the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea  with a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective,  no matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs,  this makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately followed by a minus. If we examine the starting position of any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens  marks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs  reflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable for the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1, representing you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube,  subtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do  but enjoy the fireworks."
A riddle of ice and fire dragons - Henri Picciotto,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMA7pWIFmIg,"It’s your first day in your new job  as Center Realm’s official cartographer, and you've already got a big problem. Center Realm is home to three  elder dragons: two ice, one fire, and they’ve lived in harmony  on the east coast for centuries. But scouts have sighted three fire dragons and five ice dragons flying across the Western Ocean. You’ll only have a few hours to assign  them their designated regions before they’ll arrive. Elder dragons are extremely territorial. Each must have its own,  officially acknowledged stomping ground. They’ll peacefully roost there unless their region borders another dragon of the same type, in which case the matching dragons  will go on a rampage. However, fire and ice dragons  can border each other, and matching regions can touch at corners. You’ll soon have 11 dragons and just 8 regions. Fortunately, you have enough  political capital to create 3 new regions, each of which must be  completely enclosed spaces. Add more or otherwise mess this up, and you’ll lose your job and your head. Where do you draw lines  and place the new dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It isn't difficult to create three new regions. What is more challenging  is to make sure the result will keep each dragon away from its own kind. For instance, this can be  neither ice nor fire, because it borders both. However, create a new region like this, and suddenly there are viable options. Why did that work? Look at the point where these four regions meet. If you go around it, it alternates between fire and ice. Before the new line was added, that wouldn’t have worked. Nor would 5 or 7 regions. 6 and 8, however, both do. The pattern is that points where lines meet must be surrounded by an even number of regions. As long as that’s true, you can color  the map in two colors, by alternating them around those points. In our initial arrangement, there were six such meeting points. So what we want to do is connect those to each other. Each line adds a single new region that touches both meeting points. There are several ways to do this to accommodate all 8 new dragons. You’ve done such a great job  that your boss puts you in a ship and sends you out across the Western Sea to investigate where these new dragons are coming from. There you’re met with a civilization in disarray. Their 17 elder dragons are ravaging  the countryside, wiping out the peasants, devastating all the people  and their thatch-roofed cottages. And here there aren't just ice and fire dragons, but lightning dragons too. Their people will only allow  the creation of two new regions. Where do you create new regions and place all the dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Unfortunately, our meeting-point trick won’t suffice now that there are three dragon types, so we need to find another method to identify problem areas. A great way to do so is to experiment: focus on one area and start coloring until we run out of possibilities. Take this section. These 3 regions all border each other, so they need to be different colors. But they also all touch this giant territory, which we now can’t color. To generalize the issue, when there are 4 regions that all border each other, it's impossible to color them with three colors. The map has two other such areas. So what you need to do is break them up. And once again, the key is drawing lines between points where multiple problematic regions touch. No matter how you do it, you’ll effectively subdivide  the giant territory into smaller ones. Now coloring the map becomes a logic puzzle. So long as you approach it systematically by starting in one area and radiating out, you’ll reach an arrangement  that you can fit all your dragons into, shifting the colors as needed. Just assign this region last,  because it’ll have two options. You've saved not one, but two continents from certain ruin. Now to see if you can find a giant eagle and hitch a ride back home."
What’s a smartphone made of? - Kim Preshoff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIdJ22AfsO8,"As of 2018, there are around  2.5 billion smartphone users in the world. If we broke open all their newest phones, which are just a fraction  of the total that’ve been built, and split them into their component parts, that would produce  around 85,000 kilograms of gold, 875,000 of silver, and 40 million kilograms of copper. How did this precious cache  get into our phones, and can we reclaim it? Gold, silver, and copper  are actually just a few of the 70 or so chemical elements  that make up the average smartphone. These can be divided  into different groups, two of the most critical  being rare earth elements and precious metals. Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements that are actually common in Earth’s crust and are found in many areas across  the world in low concentrations. These elements have a huge range of magnetic, phosphorescent, and conductive properties that make them crucial  to modern technologies. In fact, of the 17 types  of rare earth metals, phones and other electronics  may contain up to 16. In smartphones, these create the screen  and color display, aid conductivity, and produce the signature vibrations, amongst other things. And yet, crucial as they are, extracting these elements from the earth is linked to some disturbing  environmental impacts. Rare earth elements can often be found, but in many areas, it’s not economically feasible  to extract them due to low concentrations. Much of the time, extracting them requires  a method called open pit mining that exposes vast areas of land. This form of mining destroys  huge swaths of natural habitats, and causes air and water pollution, threatening the health  of nearby communities. Another group of ingredients  in smartphones comes with similar environmental risks: these are metals such as copper, silver, palladium, aluminum, platinum, tungsten, tin, lead, and gold. We also mine magnesium, lithium, silica, and potassium to make phones, and all of it is associated  with vast habitat destruction, as well as air and water pollution. Mining comes with  worrying social problems, too, like large-scale human  and animal displacement to make way for industrial operations, and frequently,  poor working conditions for laborers. Lastly, phone production  also requires petroleum, one of the main drivers of climate change. That entwines our smartphones inextricably with this growing planetary conundrum. And, what’s more, the ingredients we mine  to make our phones aren’t infinite. One day, they’ll simply run out, and we haven’t yet discovered effective  replacements for some. Despite this, the number of smartphones  is on a steady increase; by 2019 it’s predicted that  there’ll be close to 3 billion in use. This means that reclaiming the bounty  within our phones is swiftly becoming a necessity. So, if you have an old phone, you might want to consider your options  before throwing it away. To minimize waste, you could donate it  to a charity for reuse, take it to an e-waste recycling facility, or look for a company  that refurbishes old models. However, even recycling companies  need our scrutiny. Just as the production of smartphones comes with social  and environmental problems, dismantling them does too. E-waste is sometimes intentionally  exported to countries where labor is cheap  but working conditions are poor. Vast workforces,  often made up of women and children, may be underpaid, lack the training  to safely disassemble phones, and be exposed to elements  like lead and mercury, which can permanently damage  their nervous systems. Phone waste can also end up  in huge dump sites, leaching toxic chemicals  into the soil and water, mirroring the problems of the mines  where the elements originated. A phone is much more than it appears  to be on the surface. It’s an assemblage of elements from multiple countries, linked to impacts  that are unfolding on a global scale. So, until someone invents  a completely sustainable smartphone, we’ll need to come to terms with how this technology affects widespread places and people."
How to think about gravity - Jon Bergmann,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY3XV_GGV0M,"Transcriber: Ido Dekkers Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo So what is gravity? I bet most of you think it's: ""What goes up, must come down!"" Is that right? Well, sorta, but not really. Technically, the law of gravity is an equation. It is: F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and R is the distance between them squared. That was easy, right? Probably not. What does this actually mean? Well it means that - well, everything is attracted to everything else. What I mean by that is if you have two objects, any two objects, they are attracted to each other. OK. Let's try and wrap our minds around this. What happens when you drop a rock off a cliff? It falls to the earth. Right? Well, yes, but something else happens. You see, the law of gravity says that both objects, the rock and the earth, are attracted to each other. This means that the rock falls towards the earth, and the earth falls towards the rock. Wait a second - you mean to tell me that if - the earth falls up to meet the rock? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And the reason you don't see the earth fall up to meet the rock is because the objects move towards each other proportionate to their respective masses. The earth is much much much more massive than the rock, so it moves a very very small distance, and the rock is much less massive, so it moves farther with respect to the earth. Maybe a better way to understand gravity is to take two teenagers in spacesuits, and place them far out in space - away from all the planets and the stars. It turns out they will be attracted to each other. I'm not talking about that kind of attraction. See, they have mass, and since they have mass, they will move towards each other. They are attracted to each other. Maybe one more thing might help. Have you ever played with two magnets? You know, the magnets with the north and the south poles? When you take the magnets and put them closer to each other, they move together. They are attracted to each other. And the closer they are, the stronger the attraction. Think of the mass of the object like the strength of a magnet and the distance between the objects like the distance between the two magnets. Now understand, I'm not saying that gravity and magnetism are the same, they just behave in a similar way. Let's think of one other thing - astronauts. You know, astronauts, they weigh less on the moon than on the earth. Why is that? Well you see, the moon is less massive than the earth. Therefore it has a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut. It's like the moon is a weaker magnet. They aren't as attracted to each other. Distance also plays a role. Think back to playing with a magnet. The pull of the magnets towards each other are stronger when they are closer together. The same is true of gravity. For example, the sun is the most massive object near the earth. It dictates most of the gravitational forces in our solar system. It is very very massive. But it is relatively far away, so even though the sun is a much stronger magnet, so to speak, it is a long ways away. Therefore the attraction isn't as strong. So let's look back at that law of gravity. The equation: F = G x M1 x M2 / R ^2. You see the force of gravity is equal to a number. That's that universal gravitational constant G times the mass of object one, times the mass of object two. Think of M1 being the mass of the sun and M2 being the mass of the earth. And then we divide by the distance between them squared. This determines the force of attraction between the sun and earth. You could just as easily plug in your mass and the earth's mass and the distance between you and the center of the earth, and find out how much you are attracted to the earth, and the earth attracted to you. So, what's gravity? Everything is attracted to everything else. Everything. Oh, one last thing, just to make you wonder. What causes gravity? Why are two objects with mass attracted to each other? Well, the answer is - We don't know. The cause of gravity remains a mystery to scientists. We don't really know conclusively what causes gravity. It is one of the great mysteries of science."
The great conspiracy against Julius Caesar - Kathryn Tempest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgPymD-NBQU,"What would you do if you thought  your country was on the path to tyranny? If you saw one man gaining too much power, would you try to stop him? Even if that man was one of your closest friends and allies? These were the questions haunting Roman Senator Marcus Junius Brutus in 44 BCE, the year Julius Caesar  would be assassinated. Opposing unchecked power  wasn't just a political matter for Brutus; it was a personal one. He claimed descent from Lucius Junius Brutus, who had helped overthrow the tyrannical king known as Tarquin the Proud. Instead of seizing power himself, the elder Brutus led the people in a rousing oath to never again allow a king to rule. Rome became a republic based on the principle that no one man should hold too much power. Now, four and a half centuries later, this principle was threatened. Julius Ceasar's rise  to the powerful position of consul had been dramatic. Years of military triumphs  had made him the wealthiest man in Rome. And after defeating his rival Pompey the Great in a bitter civil war, his power was at its peak. His victories and initiatives,  such as distributing lands to the poor, had made him popular with the public, and many senators vied for his favor  by showering him with honors. Statues were built,  temples were dedicated, and a whole month was renamed, still called July today. More importantly, the title of dictator, meant to grant temporary emergency powers in wartime, had been bestowed upon Caesar  several times in succession. And in 44 BCE,  he was made dictator perpetuo, dictator for a potentially unlimited term. All of this was too much for the senators who feared a return to the monarchy their ancestors had fought to abolish, as well as those whose  own power and ambition were impeded by Caesar's rule. A group of conspirators  calling themselves the liberators began to secretly discuss plans for assassination. Leading them were the senator Gaius Cassius Longinus and his friend and brother-in-law, Brutus. Joining the conspiracy was not  an easy choice for Brutus. Even though Brutus had sided with Pompey  in the ill-fated civil war, Caesar had personally intervened  to save his life, not only pardoning him but even accepting him as a close advisor and elevating him to important posts. Brutus was hesitant to conspire against the man who had treated him like a son, but in the end, Cassius's insistence and Brutus's own fear of Caesar's ambitions won out. The moment they had been waiting for came on March 15. At a senate meeting held shortly before Caesar was to depart on his next military campaign, as many as 60 conspirators surrounded him, unsheathing daggers from their togas and stabbing at him from all sides. As the story goes, Caesar struggled fiercely until he saw Brutus. Despite the famous line, ""Et tu, Brute?""  written by Shakespeare, we don't know Caesar's actual dying words. Some ancient sources claim he said nothing, while others record the phrase,  ""And you, child?"", fueling speculation that Brutus may have actually been Caesar's illegitimate son. But all agree that when  Caesar saw Brutus among his attackers, he covered his face and gave up the fight, falling to the ground  after being stabbed 23 times. Unfortunately for Brutus, he and the other conspirators  had underestimated Caesar's popularity among the Roman public, many of whom saw  him as an effective leader, and the senate as a corrupt aristocracy. Within moments of Caesar's assassination, Rome was in a state of panic. Most of the other senators had fled, while the assassins barricaded themselves on the Capitoline Hill. Mark Antony,  Caesar's friend and co-consul, was swift to seize the upper hand, delivering a passionate speech  at Caesar's funeral days later that whipped the crowd into a frenzy  of grief and anger. As a result, the liberators  were forced out of Rome. The ensuing power vacuum  led to a series of civil wars, during which Brutus,  facing certain defeat, took his own life. Ironically, the ultimate result would be the opposite of what the conspirators had hoped to accomplish: the end of the Republic and the concentration of power  under the office of Emperor. Opinions over the assassination of Caesar  were divided from the start and have remained so. As for Brutus himself, few historical figures have inspired  such a conflicting legacy. In Dante's ""Inferno,"" he was placed  in the very center of Hell and eternally chewed by Satan himself for his crime of betrayal. But Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels"" described him as one of the most virtuous and benevolent people to have lived. The interpretation of Brutus as either a selfless fighter against dictatorship or an opportunistic traitor has shifted with the tides  of history and politics. But even today, over 2000 years later, questions about the price of liberty, the conflict between  personal loyalties and universal ideals, and unintended consequences remain more relevant than ever."
The true power of the performing arts - Ben Cameron,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbIas5MAQn0,I am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod an iPod that contains vogner and Mozart pop diva Christina Aguilera country singer Josh Turner got gangster rap artist Kirk Franklin concerto symphonies and more and more I'm a voracious reader a reader who do deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephenie Meyer I have read the Twilight tetralogy and one who lives for my home theater a home theater write of our DVDs video-on-demand and for a lot of television for me Law & Order SVU Tina Fey and 30 rock and Judge Judy the people are real the cases are real the rulings are final now I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for Judge Judy and you fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theatre and more and more and more you know frankly it's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems we now realize that the Internet is if anything too effective in that regard depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and five thousand different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day we now know in fact that technology's our biggest competitor for leisure time five years ago Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV the majority on TV Gen Y are spent even more twenty three point eight hours the majority online and now a typical in a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined moreover we're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at 3:00 in the morning or 8:00 at night ordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types ex expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attended inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet and we're all acutely aware what's it gonna mean in the future when we asked someone to pay $100 for a symphony opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the Internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry the magazine industry the book and publishing industry and more saddled in the Performing Arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction in streaming locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues where we charge exorbitant prices many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves are we next everyone I talked to in performing arts resonates to the world of aid words of Adrian rich who in dreams of a common language wrote we are out in a country that has no language no laws whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out-of-date by years and for those of you who love the arts aren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day now rather than saying that we're a bit brink of our own annihilation I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental Reformation a Reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century the arts Reformation like the religious Reformation is spurred in part by technology with indeed the printing press really leading the charge on the religious and Reformation both Reformation czar predicated on fractious discussion internal self-doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models and at heart both Reformation I think we're asking the questions who's entitled to practice how are they entitled to practice and indeed do we need anyone to inter mediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine Chris Anderson someone I trust you all know editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and author of the long tale really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet web cell a web technology minicams and more the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn't know a 14-year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the 30s Warner Brothers RKO did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what we're seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations this group others have called the pro Am's amateur artists doing work at a professional level you see them on YouTube and dance competitions film festivals and more they are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions ultimately we now live in a world defined not by consumption but by participation but I want to be clear just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal church or to the priesthood I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home but to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community as by far too short-sighted and indeed while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women's rights or human rights around global warming issues or AIDS relief or more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment today's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada but by Liz Lerman's dance exchange a multi-generational professional dance company whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN today's professional theater community is defined not only by the Shah and Stratford festivals but by the cornerstone Theatre of Los Angeles a collective of artists that after nine Levin brought together ten different religious communities the Baha'i the Catholic the Muslim the Jewish even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross community healing today's performers like we're deaf salons work in women's prisons helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs do you find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more and indeed I think rather than being annihilated the Performing Arts are poised on the brink of a time where we will be more important than we have ever been you know we've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy dollars spent in restaurants from parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano tuner who chooses the instruments and more but the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward especially in industries we can't even imagine yet just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries which few if any of us could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence the ability to listen deeply to have empathy to articulate change to motivate others the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter especially now as we all must confront the fallacy of a market only orientation uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the Arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience ultimately especially now in this world where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws in reality-tv that thrives on humiliation and in its context of announcements where the thing we hear most repeatedly day-in day-out in the United States in every train station every bus station every plane station is ladies and gentlemen please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us together invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god knows if we have ever needed that capacity in human history we need it now you know we're bound together not I think by Technology Entertainment Design but by common cause we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering to promote a more thoughtful subjective empathic World Order I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come and I thank you for your kindness and your patience and listening to me this afternoon thank you and Godspeed
How to understand power - Eric Liu,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_Eutci7ack,"Every day of your life, you move through systems of power that other people made. Do you sense them? Do you understand power? Do you realize why it matters? Power is something we are often uncomfortable talking about. That's especially true in civic life, how we live together in community. In a democracy, power is supposed to reside with the people, period. Any further talk about power and who really has it seems a little dirty, maybe even evil. But power is no more inherently good or evil than fire or physics. It just is. It governs how any form of  government works. It determines who gets to determine the rules of the game. So learning how power operates is key to being effective, being taken seriously, and not being taken advantage of. In this lesson, we'll look at where power comes from, how it's exercised and what you can do to become more powerful in public life. Let's start with a basic definition. Power is the ability to make others do what you would have them do. Of course, this plays out in  all arenas of life, from family to the workplace  to our relationships. Our focus is on the civic arena, where power means getting a community to make the choices and to take the actions that you want. There are six main sources of civic power. First, there's physical force and a capacity for violence. Control of the means of force, whether in the police or a militia, is power at its most primal. A second core source  of power is wealth. Money creates the ability to buy results and to buy almost any other kind of power. The third form of power is state action, government. This is the use of law and  bureaucracy to compel people to do or not do certain things. In a democracy, for example, we the people, theoretically, give government its power through elections. In a dictatorship, state power emerges from the threat of force, not the consent of the governed. The fourth type of power is social norms or what other people think is okay. Norms don't have the centralized machinery of government. They operate in a softer way, peer to peer. They can certainly make people change behavior and even change laws. Think about how norms around marriage equality today are evolving. The fifth form of power is ideas. An idea, individual liberties, say, or racial equality, can generate boundless amounts of power if it motivates enough people to change their thinking and actions. And so the sixth source of  power is numbers, lots of humans. A vocal mass of people creates power by expressing collective intensity of interest and by asserting legitimacy. Think of the Arab Spring or the rise of the Tea Party. Crowds count. These are the six main sources of power, what power is. So now, let's think about how power operates. There are three laws of power  worth examining. Law number one: power is never static. It's always either accumulating or decaying in a civic arena. So if you aren't taking action, you're being acted upon. Law number two: power is like water. It flows like a current  through everyday life. Politics is the work of harnessing  that flow in a direction you prefer. Policymaking is an effort to freeze and perpetuate a particular flow of power. Policy is power frozen. Law number three: power compounds. Power begets more power, and so does powerlessness. The only thing that keeps law number three from leading to a situation where only one person has all the power is how we apply laws one and two. What rules do we set up so that a few people don't accumulate too much power, and so that they can't enshrine their privilege in policy? That's the question of democracy, and you can see each of these laws at work in any news story. Low wage workers organize to get higher pay. Oil companies push to get a big pipeline approved. Gay and lesbian couples seek the legal right to marry. Urban parents demand school vouchers. You may support these efforts or not. Whether you get what you want depends on how adept you are with power, which brings us finally to what you can do to become more powerful in public life. Here, it's useful to think in terms of literacy. Your challenge is to learn how to read  power and write power. To read power means to pay attention to as many texts of power as you can. I don't mean books only. I mean seeing society as a set of texts. Don't like how things are in your campus or city or country? Map out who has what kind of power, arrayed in what systems. Understand why it turned out this way, who's made it so,  and who wants to keep it so. Study the strategies others in such situations used: frontal attack or indirection, coalitions or charismatic authority. Read so you may write. To write power requires first that you  believe you have the right to write, to be an author of change. You do. As with any kind of writing, you learn to express yourself, speak up in a voice that's authentic. Organize your ideas,  then organize other people. Practice consensus building. Practice conflict. As with writing, it's all about practice. Every day you have a chance to practice, in your neighborhood and beyond. Set objectives, then bigger ones. Watch the patterns, see what works. Adapt, repeat. This is citizenship. In this short lesson, we've explored where civic power comes from, how it works and what you can do to exercise it. One big question remaining is the ""why"" of power. Do you want power to benefit everyone or only you? Are your purposes pro-social or anti-social? This question isn't about strategy. It's about character, and that's another set of lessons. But remember this: Power plus character equals a great citizen, and you have the power to be one."
A different way to visualize rhythm - John Varney,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UphAzryVpY,"We usually think of rhythm as an element of music, but it's actually found everywhere in the world around us, from the ocean tides to our own heartbeats, rhythm is essentially an event repeating regularly over time. Even the ticking of a clock itself is a sort of rhythm. But for musical rhythm, a steady string of repeating single beats is not enough. For that, we need at least one opposing beat with a different sound, which can be the unstressed off beat or the accented back beat. There are several ways to make these beats distinct, whether by using high and low drums, or long and short beats. Which ends up being heard as the main beat is not a precise rule, but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be reversed depending on cultural perception. In standard notation, rhythm is indicated on a musical bar line, but there are other ways. Remember that ticking clock? Just as its round face can trace the linear passage of time, the flow of rhythm can be  traced in a circle. The continuity of a wheel can be a more intuitive way to visualize rhythm than a linear score that requires moving back and forth along the page. We can mark the beats at different positions around the circle using blue dots for main beats, orange ones for off beats, and white dots for secondary beats. Here is a basic two beat rhythm with a main beat and an opposing off beat. Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat, an off beat, and a secondary beat. And the spaces between each beat can be divided into further sub-beats using multiples of either two or three. Layering multiple patterns using concentric wheels lets us create more complex rhythms. For example, we can combine a basic  two beat rhythm with off beats to get a four beat system. This is the recognizable backbone of many genres popular around the world, from rock, country, and jazz, to reggae and cumbia. Or we can combine a two beat rhythm with a three beat one. Eliminating the extra main beat and rotating the inner wheel leaves us with a rhythm whose  underlying feel is three-four. This is the basis of the music of Whirling Dervishes, as well as a broad range of  Latin American rhythms, such as Joropo, and even Bach's famous Chaconne. Now if we remember Rubin's vase and hear the off beats as the main beats, this will give us a six-eight feel, as found in genres such as Chacarera, and Quechua, Persian music and more. In an eight beat system, we have three layered circles, each rhythm played by  a different instrument. We can then add an outermost layer consisting of an additive  rhythmic component, reinforcing the main beat and increasing accuracy. Now let's remove everything except for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top. This rhythmic configuration is found as the Cuban cinquillo, in the Puerto Rican bomba, and in Northern Romanian music. And rotating the outer circle 90 degrees counterclockwise gives us a pattern often found in Middle Eastern music, as well as Brazilian choro, and Argentinian tango. In all of these examples, the underlying rhythm reinforces the basic one-two, but in different ways depending on  arrangement and cultural context. So it turns out that the wheel method is more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms. By freeing us from the tyranny of the bar line, we can visualize rhythm  in terms of time, and a simple turn of the wheel can take us on a musical journey around the world."
The historical audacity of the Louisiana Purchase - Judy Walton,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMh8RCqJf9U,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you heard the one about Thomas Jefferson and the Louisiana Territory? Thomas Jefferson, author of The Declaration of Independence, was not a fan of the new constitution presented in 1787. He was very worried that The Constitution gave too much power to the new, national government, and not enough power to the states, an issue known as ""big government"". Jefferson only reluctantly agreed to support it when his friend, James Madison, promised to propose a bill of rights after it was ratified. But Jefferson's fears about big government did not go away. For example, Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, proposed a national bank in 1790, and Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to permit such a thing. Hamilton claimed some sort of implied powers mumbo-jumbo. Sure, it wasn't written in The Constitution, but The Constitution implied that it could be done. But, Jefferson wasn't buying it. Nonetheless, the bank was established by Hamilton and President Washington. When Jefferson was sworn in as President in 1801, he pledged to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But, of course, things didn't go exactly as he had planned. Spain secretly transferred the Louisiana Territory to France right beneath Jefferson's nose. When Congress found out, they quickly began discussions with France to buy a piece of the territory along the Mississippi River for about $2 million. But, there was one little problem: Jefferson knew there was no provision in The Constitution to buy foreign territory. So what was a strict constructionist to do? First, he tried to get an amendment to The Constitution passed that would expressly permit the purchase, but Congress wasn't willing to do it. Then, without permission, the U.S. negotiators in France cut a deal for all of the territory for a cool $15 million dollars. That new land doubled the size of the nation! Now Jefferson was really stuck. He knew that the territory would be a great acquisition for the country, providing lots of new land for farmers and other settlers, but how could he constitutionally justify it? In the end, Jefferson turned to the argument used by his old foe Alexander Hamilton. He claimed that the power to purchase the territory is implied in The Constitution's treaty-making power. This was the exact argument that he had mocked openly a decade before, so it must have crushed his pride to have to use it. But more importantly, he may have committed the biggest big government play ever! How ironic is it that one of the biggest opponents of big government doubled the size of the young country and did so while openly questioning its constitutionality? At $15 million, which is about three cents an acre, it has been called by many the greatest real estate deal in the history of the United States."
How to perform brain surgery without making a single cut - Hyunsoo Joshua No,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d_dtVTs4CM,"Every year, tens of thousands of people world-wide have brain surgery without a single incision: there’s no scalpel, no operating table,  and the patient loses no blood. Instead, this procedure takes place  in a shielded room with a large machine that emits  invisible beams of light at a precise target inside the brain. This treatment is called  stereotactic radiosurgery, and those light beams  are beams of radiation: their task is to destroy tumors by gradually scrubbing away malignant cells. For patients, the process begins  with a CT-scan, a series of x-rays that produce  a three-dimensional map of the head. This reveals the precise location, size, and shape of the tumor within. The CT-scans also help to calculate something called ""Hounsfield Units,"" which show the densities of different tissues. This offers information  about how radiation will propagate through the brain, to better optimize its effects. Doctors might also use  magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI’s, that produce finer images of soft tissue, to assist in better outlining  a tumor’s shape and location. Mapping its precise position and size  is crucial because of the high doses of radiation needed to treat tumors. Radiosurgery depends on the use of multiple beams. Individually, each delivers a low dose of radiation. But, like several stage lights converging on the same point to create a bright and inescapable spotlight, when combined, the rays of radiation collectively produce enough power to destroy tumors. In addition to enabling doctors to target tumors in the brain while leaving the surrounding  healthy tissue relatively unharmed, the use of multiple beams  also gives doctors flexibility. They can optimize the best angles  and routes through brain tissue to reach the target and adjust  the intensity within each beam as necessary. This helps spare critical structures within the brain. But what exactly does this ingenious approach do to the tumors in question? When several beams of radiation intersect to strike a mass of cancerous cells, their combined force essentially shears the cells’ DNA, causing a breakdown in the cells’ structure. Over time, this process cascades  into destroying the whole tumor. Indirectly, the rays also damage the area immediately surrounding the DNA, creating unstable particles called free radicals. This generates a hazardous  microenvironment that’s inhospitable to the tumor, as well as some healthy cells  in the immediate vicinity. The risk of harming non-cancerous tissue is reduced by keeping the radiation beam coverage as close to the exact shape of the tumor as possible. Once radiosurgery treatment has destroyed the tumor’s cells, the body’s natural cleaning mechanism kicks in. The immune system rapidly sweeps up the husks of dead cells to flush them out of the body, while other cells transform into scar tissue. Despite its innovations, radiosurgery isn’t always the primary choice for all brain cancer treatments. For starters, it’s typically reserved  for smaller tumors. Radiation also has a cumulative effect, meaning that earlier doses can overlap with those delivered later on. So patients with recurrent tumors may have limitations with future radiosurgery treatments. But these disadvantages weigh up  against some much larger benefits. For several types of brain tumors, radiosurgery can be as successful  as traditional brain surgery at destroying cancerous cells. In tumors called meningiomas,  recurrence is found to be equal, or lower, when the patient undergoes radiosurgery. And compared to traditional surgery— often a painful experience  with a long recovery period— radiosurgery is generally pain-free, and often requires  little to no recovery time. Brain tumors aren’t the only target  for this type of treatment: its concepts have been put to use on tumors of the lungs, liver, and pancreas. Meanwhile, doctors are experimenting with using it to treat conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and obsessive compulsive disorder. The pain of a cancer diagnosis  can be devastating, but advancements in these  non-invasive procedures are paving a pathway for a more gentle cure."
Ethical dilemma: Should we get rid of mosquitoes? - Talya Hackett,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7i9Anh0_Dg,"Because of the pathogens they carry, mosquitoes are responsible for more human deaths every year than any other animal, including other humans. But very few of the 3,500 mosquito species actually transmit deadly diseases  to humans. So what if we could get rid  of the most lethal mosquitoes? Over the last two decades, scientists have begun conducting experiments using engineered technologies called “gene drives” that could theoretically do just that. So, should we? To begin grappling with this question, we have to get a sense of how the technology works. In the usual process of inheritance, the genomes of each parent  recombine randomly. So their offspring end up with the DNA  that’s a rough 50/50 mix from their parents. But gene drives thwart this process and ensure they're passed on. Gene drives are found in nature but, using new gene-editing technology, scientists have also begun engineering them in contained labs. For example, in a 2018 study, researchers injected a gene drive into mosquito eggs that made females sterile when they had  two copies of the modified gene. Such a modification would usually disappear quickly. But it spread. The modified mosquitoes passed the  gene drive onto some of their offspring. The gene drive, which they inherited on one chromosome, copied itself onto the other chromosome in the offspring’s sperm and egg cells, ensuring it was passed on to their offspring, regardless of which chromosome they received. This process repeated as all males that carried the gene and all females that had one copy of it, continued reproducing, spreading the gene drive. As they did, they produced more females  that had two copies of the gene— and would therefore sterile. With a near 100% inheritance rate,  the gene spread through the population and within 12 generations almost all females were sterile, and the populations crashed. In 2020, the same team achieved a similar result with a gene drive that made populations male-only. Gene drives have proven powerful in the lab. So, implementing them in the wild is a big decision— one that’s being considered because of how the fight against mosquito-borne diseases is going. Existing mosquito control measures,  like insecticide-treated bed nets, helped reduce the number of deaths  from malaria, the deadliest mosquito-borne disease, between 2000 and 2019. But fatalities have begun rising again. Many mosquitoes have developed insecticide resistance— and insecticides kill more than just mosquitoes. In addition to the first-ever  malaria vaccine, approved in October of 2021, many see promise in gene drives. Experts are researching what it would look like to specifically target the deadliest mosquito populations  with this technology. Like Anopheles gambiae, for instance: the species overwhelmingly responsible for spreading malaria in Equatorial Africa, which experiences the vast majority of mosquito-related fatalities. The idea is that,  when a gene-drive-affected population of Anopheles gambiae drops low enough, it would break the malaria  transmission cycle. But before gene drive mosquitoes are actually released into the wild, some big questions need answers. Like, could gene drives cross into and cause the collapse of non-target species? It doesn’t seem that many  mosquito species interbreed, making this unlikely, but scientists are conducting research to be certain. And how might a mosquito population’s collapse affect ecosystems? One team is examining the feces  and stomach contents of insectivores in Ghana to gauge the role of Anopheles gambiae in local food webs. And researchers are investigating whether suppressing populations could make other insects more vulnerable or leave a niche open that a harmful species could occupy. Scientists are also exploring alternatives to population collapse, like gene drives that instead  make mosquitoes resistant to the malaria parasite. And others are developing countermeasures  to reverse the effects of gene drives if needed. Meanwhile, some people have called for gene drive research to halt out of concern  for the possible consequences. This raises another question: who should decide whether to release gene drives? It’s essential that communities, scientists, regulators, and governments of the countries most  affected by mosquito-borne diseases be highly involved in the research  and decision-making processes. Conversations are currently underway at all levels to establish a system to manage  this new area of research— and the ethical questions it carries."
Inside your computer - Bettina Bair,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA,"Do you remember when you first realized that your computer was more than just a monitor and keyboard? That between the mouse click and the video playing, there was something that captured your intention, understood it, and made it real? What is that something? Is it gremlins? Let's imagine that we can shrink down to the size of an electron and inject ourselves into a click of a mouse. If you took your mouse apart, you'd see that it's really a very simple machine. It has a couple buttons and a system for detecting motion and distance. You might have an optical mouse that makes these measurements with lights and sensors, but older ones did this with a hard rubber ball and some plastic wheels. Same concept. When you click the button on your mouse, it sends a message to the computer with information about its position. When your mouse click is received, it's handled by the basic input/output subsystem. This subsystem acts like the eyes and ears and mouth and hands of the computer. Basically, it provides a way for the computer to interact with its environment. But it also acts like a buffer to keep the CPU from being overwhelmed by distractions. In this case, the I/O subsystem decides that your mouse click is pretty important so it generates an interrupt to the CPU. ""Hey, CPU! Got a click here."" The CPU, or central processing unit, is the brains of the whole computer. Just like your brain doesn't take up your whole body, the CPU doesn't take up the whole computer, but it runs the show all the same. And the CPU's job, its whole job, is fetching instructions from memory and executing them. So, while you're typing, typing, typing, maybe really fast, like 60 words a minute, the CPU is fetching and executing billions of instructions a second. Yes, billions every second: instructions to move your mouse around on the screen, to run that clock widget on your desktop, play your internet radio, manage the files you're editing on the hard drive, and much, much more. Your computer's CPU is one heck of a multitasker! ""But oh my gosh there's a very important mouse click coming through now! Let's drop everything now and deal with that!"" There are programs for everything that the CPU does. A special program for the mouse, for the clock widget, for the internet radio, and for dealing with letters sent by the keyboard. Each program was initially written by a human in a human-readable programming language, like Java, C++, or Python. But human programs take up a lot of space and contain a lot of unnecessary information to a computer, so they are compiled and made smaller and stored in bits of ones and zeros in memory. The CPU realizes that it needs instructions for how to deal with this mouse click, so it looks up the address for the mouse program and sends a request to the memory subsystem for instructions stored there. Each instruction in the mouse device driver is duly fetched and executed. And that's not nearly the end of the story! Because the CPU learns that the mouse was clicked when the cursor was over a picture of a button on the monitor screen, and so, the CPU asks memory for the monitor program to find out what that button is. And then the CPU has to ask memory for the program for the button, which means that the CPU needs the monitor program again to show the video associated with the button, and so it goes. And let's just say there are a lot of programs involved before you even see the button on the screen light up when you clicked it. So, just the simple task of clicking your mouse means visiting all of the critical components of your computer's architecture: peripherals, the basic input-output system, the CPU, programs, and memory, and not one gremlin."
What is déjà vu? What is déjà vu? - Michael Molina,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foVMwJtlR5s,"Have you experienced déjà vu? It's that shadowy feeling you get when a situation seems familiar. A scene in a restaurant plays out exactly as you remember. The world moves like a ballet you've choreographed, but the sequence can't be based on a past experience because you've never eaten here before. This is the first time you've had clams, so what's going on? Unfortunately, there isn't one single explanation for déjà vu. The experience is brief and occurs without notice, making it nearly impossible for scientists to record and study it. Scientists can't simply sit around and wait for it to happen to them -- this could take years. It has no physical manifestations and in studies, it's described by the subject as a sensation or feeling. Because of this lack of hard evidence, there's been a surplus of speculation over the years. Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu as a French term meaning ""already seen,"" more than 40 theories attempt to explain this phenomenon. Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging and cognitive psychology narrow down the field of prospects. Let's walk through three of today's more prevalent theories, using the same restaurant setting for each. First up is dual processing. We'll need an action. Let's go with a waiter dropping a tray of dishes. As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres process a flurry of information: the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell of pasta. Within milliseconds, this information zips through pathways and is processed into a single moment. Most of the time, everything is recorded in-sync. However, this theory asserts that déjà vu occurs when there's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways. The difference in arrival times causes the brain to interpret the late information as a separate event. When it plays over the already-recorded moment, it feels as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has. Our next theory deals with a confusion of the past rather than a mistake in the present. This is the hologram theory, and we'll use that tablecloth to examine it. As you scan its squares, a distant memory swims up from deep within your brain. According to the theory, this is because memories are stored in the form of holograms, and in holograms, you only need one fragment to see the whole picture. Your brain has identified the tablecloth with one from the past, maybe from your grandmother's house. However, instead of remembering that you've seen it at your grandmother's, your brain has summoned up the old memory without identifying it. This leaves you stuck with familiarity, but no recollection. Although you've never been in this restaurant, you've seen that tablecloth but are just failing to identify it. Now, look at this fork. Are you paying attention? Our last theory is divided attention, and it states that déjà vu occurs when our brain subliminally takes in an environment while we're distracted by one particular object. When our attention returns, we feel as if we've been here before. For example, just now you focused on the fork and didn't observe the tablecloth or the falling waiter. Although your brain has been recording everything in your peripheral vision, it's been doing so below conscious awareness. When you finally pull yourself away from the fork, you think you've been here before because you have, you just weren't paying attention. While all three of these theories share the common features of déjà vu, none of them propose to be the conclusive source of the phenomenon. Still, while we wait for researchers and inventers to come up with new ways to capture this fleeting moment, we can study the moment ourselves. After all, most studies of déjà vu are based on first-hand accounts, so why can't one be yours? The next time you get déjà vu, take a moment to think about it. Have you been distracted? Is there a familiar object somewhere? Is your brain just acting slow? Or is it something else?"
Ugly History: Japanese American incarceration camps - Densho,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI4NoVWq87M,"On December 7, 1941, 16 year-old Aki Kurose shared in the  horror of millions of Americans when Japanese planes  attacked Pearl Harbor. What she did not know, was how that shared experience would soon leave her family and  over 120,000 Japanese Americans alienated from their country, both socially and physically. As of 1941, Japanese American communities had been growing in the US for over 50 years. About one-third of them were immigrants, many of whom settled on the West Coast  and had lived there for decades. The rest were born as American citizens,  like Aki. Born Akiko Kato in Seattle, Aki grew up in a diverse neighborhood where she never thought of herself as anything but American– until the day after the attack, when a  teacher told her: “You people bombed Pearl Harbor."" Amid racism, paranoia,  and fears of sabotage, people labelled Japanese Americans  as potential traitors. FBI agents began to search homes,  confiscate belongings and detain community leaders  without trial. Aki’s family was not immediately subjected to these extreme measures, but on February 19, 1942, President  Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. The order authorized the removal of any  suspected enemies– including anyone of even  partial Japanese heritage– from designated ‘military areas.’ At first, Japanese Americans were pushed to leave restricted areas and migrate inland. But as the government froze  their bank accounts and imposed local restrictions  such as curfews, many were unable to leave–  Aki’s family among them. In March, a proclamation forbid Japanese  Americans from changing their residency, trapping them in military zones. In May, the army moved Aki and her family, along with over 7,000 Japanese Americans living in Seattle to ""Camp Harmony"" in Puyallup, Washington. This was one of several makeshift  detention centers at former fairgrounds and racetracks, where entire families were packed into  poorly converted stables and barracks. Over the ensuing months, the army moved Japanese Americans  into long-term camps in desolate areas of the West and South, moving Aki and her family to  Minidoka in southern Idaho. Guarded by armed soldiers, many of these camps were still being  constructed when incarcerees moved in. These hastily built prisons were  overcrowded and unsanitary. People frequently fell ill and were unable to receive proper medical care. The War Relocation Authority relied on  incarcerees to keep the camps running. Many worked in camp facilities or taught  in poorly equipped classrooms, while others raised crops and animals. Some Japanese Americans rebelled,  organizing labor strikes and even rioting. But many more,  like Aki’s parents, endured. They constantly sought to recreate some  semblance of life outside the camps, but the reality of their  situation was unavoidable. Like many younger incarcerees,  Aki was determined to leave her camp. She finished her final year  of high school at Minidoka, and with the aid of an anti-racist Quaker  organization, she was able to enroll at  Friends University in Kansas. For Aki’s family however, things wouldn’t  begin to change until late 1944. A landmark Supreme Court case ruled that continued detention of American citizens without charges was unconstitutional. In the fall of 1945, the war ended and the camps closed down. Remaining incarcerees  were given a mere $25 and a train ticket to their  pre-war address, but many no longer had a home  or job to return to. Aki’s family had been able to  keep their apartment, and Aki eventually returned  to Seattle after college. However, post-war prejudice  made finding work difficult. Incarcarees faced discrimination  and resentment from workers and tenants  who replaced them. Fortunately, Japanese Americans  weren’t alone in the fight against  racial discrimination. Aki found work with one of Seattle’s first interracial labor unions and joined the Congress  of Racial Equality. She became a teacher, and over the next several decades, her advocacy for multicultural, socially  conscious education would impact thousands of students. However, many ex-incarcerees,  particularly members of older generations, were unable to rebuild  their lives after the war. Children of incarcerees began a movement calling for the United States to atone  for this historic injustice. In 1988, the US government officially  apologized for the wartime incarceration– admitting it was the catastrophic result  of racism, hysteria, and failed political leadership. Three years after this apology, Aki Kurose was awarded the  Human Rights Award from the Seattle Chapter  of the United Nations, celebrating her vision of peace and  respect for people of all backgrounds."
The hidden life of Rosa Parks -  Riché D. Richardson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLfbmepDd4c,"In 1944, 11 years before her fateful  decision on a Montgomery Bus, Rosa Parks was investigating  a vicious crime. As an emissary for  the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama  to meet with Recy Taylor, a young woman who had been  sexually assaulted by six white men. It would be difficult enough to convince an Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend  Recy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests  throughout the South. When a jury failed  to indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor  assemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail to let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice  for all of our citizens.” Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly  challenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems  protecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her  mother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear  of racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently  drove past their home, and Jim Crow laws  segregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery and married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury  at racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter of the NAACP; a role many avoided  for fear of persecution. At first Raymond was eager  to keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the limitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined  the NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were  the only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes  for their meetings, and soon found herself elected  secretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress to support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented numerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile murder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public  responses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter, battling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns  frequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks  was a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP  youth group council, she helped young people navigate  segregated systems including voter registration and  whites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine  civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience training and spoke out against racial violence, particularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move  to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement  she had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed  for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four  hour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred  and eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed  nascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended  when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating  public transport. But this victory for the movement  had come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death  threats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery because of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit  to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman  John Conyers to help support his burgeoning  civil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial  inequality, Parks remained active  for the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks to support other activists, and established an institute  for the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered  as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful  people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done does away with fear.”"
The secret formula to Agatha Christie's murder mysteries - Jamie Bernthal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98pNh3LtV8c,"Agatha Christie is the best-selling novelist of all time. But in 1916, she wasn’t even  the most promising writer in her family. Her older sister Madge had already written several short stories, while Agatha hadn’t published any. So when Agatha shared her desire  to write a mystery novel, Madge scoffed. She bet that Agatha wouldn’t be able to create a compelling mystery— and certainly not something she couldn't solve. Today, the novel that came  of that bet stands alongside almost 100  other mysteries written by Christie, each one a cleverly constructed puzzle box of clues, misdirection, and human drama. So let's investigate how she crafted these perfect crimes. Christie designed her stories in many ways, but one of the most important decisions was the setting. From a remote island to a snow-stalled train car, she favored locations isolated from society. By restricting the scope of her stories, Christie limited possible suspects  and built tension by forcing characters to stay put— even with a killer among them. Sometimes she further heightened the drama by making the characters strangers, unsure who they can trust. But while her settings are eerie and extraordinary, her characters are just the opposite. One of the biggest criticisms of Christie’s novels is that they’re full  of two-dimensional people. But Christie avoided complex characters for a reason. By reducing people to a handful of simple traits, she provided readers  with predictable suspects. Well, usually predictable. Christie also used the audience's expectations against them. However, this typecasting sometimes relied on what contemporary readers know to be harmful stereotypes. She frequently caricatured particular occupations and ethnic groups for comic effect, reinforcing the prejudices of her time. This is certainly not an element of Christie’s work worth emulating, and fortunately,  many modern mystery writers have found less problematic ways to use this technique. Even when she got it wrong, Christie worked to make her characters feel authentic. She closely observed the people around her, and constantly scribbled down details from overheard conversations. She would then rearrange these details to piece her mysteries together, often switching who the murderer was as she worked. This approach kept information murky and disoriented even the sharpest readers. However, there’s an important balance to strike between being clever and being confusing. Nobody wants to read a predictable mystery, but if things get too convoluted you can lose your reader altogether. Christie handled this in part by keeping her language simple and accessible. She used short sentences and clear, snappy dialogue to help readers follow information. This kind of clarity is essential, because the best mysteries string their audience along with a carefully laid trail of clues. With Christie, a good clue is one the reader will remember, but usually, fail to completely understand. For example, when a character cries that “Everything tastes foul today,” just minutes before he dies, the reader races to determine who poisoned his beverage. But they’re likely failing  to truly consider this clue. If everything tasted foul that day, then he’d been poisoned long before that drink. Christie also used clues to intentionally mislead her audience. For example, readers might recognize a clue associated with one suspect, only to learn that it was being used to frame them. Other times, she built misdirection directly into the story’s structure— like when a narrator reporting the murder is revealed to be the killer. Outside crime and clues, there’s one more ingredient in Christie’s formula: the detective. Christie created many sleuths, but her most enduring are Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. Neither this petit Belgian refugee nor this elderly amateur detective are traditional heroes. But their outsider status is exactly what helps them slip past security and make suspects let their guard down. As you might have guessed, Agatha won her sister’s bet. Her eccentric detectives, clever clues, and simplified suspects form a blueprint that has stumped countless readers. And now that you've uncovered her strategies, the only mystery left is what stories you can tell with these secrets."
Are naked mole rats the strangest mammals? - Thomas Park,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sKADUBfdMk,"What mammal has  the social life of an insect, the cold-bloodedness of a reptile, and the metabolism of a plant? Bald and buck-toothed, naked mole rats  may not be pretty, but they’re extraordinary. With a lifespan of 30 years, their peculiar traits have evolved  over millions of years to make them uniquely suited  to survive harsh conditions, especially long periods without oxygen. In the deserts of East Africa,  naked mole rats feed on root vegetables. They dig for the roots with teeth that can move independently, like chopsticks. But even with these special teeth, a single naked mole rat doesn’t stand  a chance of finding enough food; the roots are large and nutritious, but scattered far and wide. A large workforce has  a much better chance, so naked mole rats live in colonies. Similar to ants, bees, and termites,  they build giant nests. Housing up to 300 mole rats, these colonies feature complex  underground tunnel systems, nest chambers, and community bathrooms. Also like insects, naked mole rats  have a rigid social structure. The dominant female, the queen, and two to three males  that she chooses, are the only naked mole rats  in the colony who have babies. All the other naked mole rats, male and female, are either soldiers, who defend  the colony from possible invaders, or workers. Teams of workers are dispatched  to hunt for roots, and their harvest feeds the whole colony. Living in a colony helps naked mole rats  find enough food, but when so many animals live in  the same underground space, oxygen quickly runs out. Mammals need a lot of oxygen; we use it to make the energy  that fuels everything from maintaining our body temperatures to our heartbeats to voluntary movements. Without oxygen, we quickly die. In fact, no other mammal could survive  the oxygen depletion experienced in a naked mole rat colony. Naked mole rats can thrive in low oxygen in part because they’ve abandoned  one of the body functions that requires the most oxygen: thermoregulation. Most mammals are warm-blooded, meaning they have to keep  their body temperature consistent. Naked mole rats don’t get enough  oxygen to do this. Instead, they’re the only mammals whose body temperature fluctuates  with their environment, making them cold-blooded, like reptiles. They also have a special  type of hemoglobin, the molecule in the blood  that transports oxygen. Their hemoglobin is much stickier  for oxygen than ours and can pick oxygen up  even when it’s scarce. In response to a real oxygen emergency, naked mole rats enter  a state of suspended animation. They stop moving, slow their breathing, and dramatically lower their heart rate. This greatly reduces the amount of energy, and therefore oxygen, they need. At the same time, they begin  to metabolize fructose, like a plant. Fructose is a sugar that can be used  to make energy without burning oxygen. Usually, mammals metabolize  a different sugar called glucose that makes more energy than fructose, but glucose only works  when oxygen’s available. Human brain and heart cells have  some cellular machinery to use fructose, but not nearly as much as naked mole rats. Naked mole rats are, in fact, the only mammals known to have this ability. While we can hope humans won’t ever need to exclusively live  in underground tunnels, there are many situations where  we would benefit from needing less oxygen. During heart attacks  and other medical emergencies, people often die or sustain debilitating  organ damage from oxygen deprivation. Could we replicate the naked mole rat’s  use of the fructose pathway for human health? It took millions of years of evolution  to bring the behavior of an insect, the temperature regulation of a reptile, and the energy production of a plant together in one little mammal, but maybe, with enough study, we can replicate just a few  of their wild adaptations."
Everyday leadership - Drew Dudley,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAy6EawKKME,how many of you are completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader see I've asked that question all the way across the country and everywhere I ask it no matter where there's always a huge portion of the audience that won't put up their hand and I've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us we made it into something beyond us we made it about changing the world and we've taken this title of leader and we treat it as if it's something that one day we're going to deserve but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with and I worry sometimes that we spend so much time celebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do that we've convinced ourselves that those are the only things we're celebrating and we start to devalue the things that we can do every day and we start to take moments where we truly are a leader and we don't let ourselves take credit for and we don't let ourselves feel good about it and I've been lucky enough over the last ten years to work with some amazing people who have helped me redefine leadership in a way that I think has made me happier and with my short time today I just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition I went to a school in a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville New Brunswick and on my last day there a girl came up to me and she said I remember the first time that I met you and then she told me a story that happened four years earlier she said on my day before I started University I was in the hotel room with my mom and my dad and I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this that I wasn't ready for university that I just burst into tears and my mom and my dad were amazing they were like look we know you're scared but let's just go to more let's go to the first day and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this that's fine just tell us we will take you home we love you no matter what and she said so I would the next day and I was standing in line getting ready for registration and I looked around and I just knew I couldn't do it I knew I wasn't ready I knew I had to quit and she says I made that decision and as soon as I made it there was this incredible feeling of peace that came over me and I turned to my mom and my dad to tell them that we needed to go home and just at that moment you came out of the Student Union Building wearing the stupidest hat I have ever seen in my life it was awesome and you had a big sign promoting Shina ramen which is students fighting cystic fibrosis the charity I've worked with for years and you had a bucket full of lollipops and you were walking along and you were handing the lollipops out to people in line and talking about shina Rama and all of a sudden you got to me and you just stopped and you stared it was creepy this girl right here knows exactly what I'm talking about and then you look at the guy next to me and you smiled and he reached in your bucket you pulled out a lollipop and you held it out to him and you said you need to give a lollypop to the beautiful woman standing next to you and she said I have never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life he turned beet red and he wouldn't even look at me he just kind of held a lollipop out like this and I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop and as soon as I did you got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad and you said look at that look at that first day away from home and already she's taking candy from a stranger and she said everybody lost it 20 feet in every direction everyone started to howl and I know this is cheesy and I don't know why I'm telling you this but in that moment when everyone was laughing I knew that I shouldn't quit I knew that I was where I was supposed to be and I knew that I was home and I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day but I heard that you were leaving and I had to come up and tell you that you've been an incredibly important person in my life and I'm gonna miss you good luck and she walks away and I'm flattened and she gets about 6 feet away she turns around and smiles and goes you should probably know this too I'm still dating that guy 4 years later a year and a half after I moved to Toronto I got an invitation to their wedding here's the kicker I don't remember that I have no recollection of that moment and I've searched my memory banks because that is funny and I should remember doing it and I don't remember it and that was such an eye-opening transformative moment for me to think that the maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say you've been an incredibly important person in my life was a moment that I didn't even remember how many of you guys have a lollipop moment a moment where someone said something or did something that you feel fundamentally made your life better alright how many of you have told that person they did it see why not we celebrate birthdays where all you have to do is not die for 365 days and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it and every single one of you every single one of you has been the catalyst for a lollipop moment you have made someone's life better by something that you said or that you did and if you think you have it think about all the hands that didn't go back up when I asked that question you're just one of the people who hasn't been told but it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful it can be frightening to think that we can matter that much to other people because as long as we make leadership something bigger than us as long as we keep leadership something beyond us as long as we make it about changing the world we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves and from each other Marianne Williamson said our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light and not our darkness that frightens us and my call to action today is that we need to get over that we need to get over our fear of how extraordinarily powerful we can be at each other's lives we need to get over it so we can move beyond it and our little brothers and our little sisters and one day our kids or our kids right now can watch a start to value the impact we can have on each other's lives more than money and power and titles and influence we need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments how many of them we create how many then we acknowledge how many of them we pay forward and how many of them we say thank you for because we've made leadership about changing the world and there is no world there's only six billion understandings of it and if you change one person's understanding of it one person's understanding of what they're capable of one person's understanding of how much people care about them one person's understanding of how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world you change the whole thing and if we can chain understand leadership like that I think if we can redefine leadership like that I think we can change everything and it's a simple idea but I don't think it's a small one and I want to thank you all so much for letting me share
Mysteries of vernacular: Bewilder - Jessica Oreck and Rachael Teel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLLAe-k1W4,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Bewilder, to confuse or puzzle completely. The root of the word bewilder can be traced back to the Old English word wilde, which was used to refer to something that was in a natural state, uncultivated, or undomesticated. Over time, the word wild was often linked to the Old English word deor. Deor, which was derived from an early Indo-European root that meant breathe, was initially used to describe any untamed animal or beast. This eventually morphed into the modern word deer, meaning a ruminant of the family Cervidae. The two Old English words, when mashed together, became wilderness, meaning a tract of uncultivated land, primarily inhabited by undomesticated beasts. From the word wilderness, the word wilder was born. To wilder someone was to lead him astray or lure him into the woods. In the 1600's, the prefix be, meaning thoroughly, was compounded with wilder as a way of tacking on a little extra punch. Someone who was bewildered was thoroughly lost in the wild. From this winding background, bewilder eventually evolved into our current definition, to be completely confused."

these on the web for everybody the media the aid organizations and the communities themselves to participate in and to use back in Haiti people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS people that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress were signaling their need for help on Street sides all over PTO France entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations s they understood more than we did people's innate need to be connected never having been confronted with this type of situation before we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and SMS technology we started talking with a local Telecom provider called VOA which is a subsidiary of Trilogy International we had basically three requirements we wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication we didn't want to shout we needed to listen as well we wanted to be able to Target specific Geographic communities we didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time we wanted it to be easy to use out of this Rubble of Haiti and from this Devastation came something that we call Terror the trilogy emergency response application which has been used to support the aid effort ever since it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters it is used to Signal early warning in advance of weather related disasters it's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of chalera and it even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence but does it work we have just published an evaluation of this program and the evidence that is there for all to see is quite remarkable some 74% of people received the data those that were intended to receive the data 74% of them received it 96% of them found it useful 83% of them took action evidence that it is indeed empowering and 73% of them shared it the Terrace system was developed from Haiti with the support of engineers in the region it is a user appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect technology is transformational right across the developing World citizens and communities are using technology to enable them bring about change positive change in their own communities the Grassroots has been strengthened to the Social Power of sharing and they are challenging the old models the old analog models of control and command one illustration of the transformational power of technology is in kaiber kaiber is one of Africa's largest slums it's on the outskirts of Nairobi the capital city of Kenya it's home to an unknown number of people some say between 250,000 and 1.2 million if you were to arrive in Nairobi today and pick up a tourist map kibber is represented as a lush green National Park the void of human settlement young people living in kibber in their Community with simple handheld devices GPS handheld devices and SMS enabled mobile phones have literally put themselves on the map they have collated crowdsource data and rendered the invisible visible people like Josh and Steve are continuing to layer information upon information realtime information tweeted and texted onto these maps for all to use you can find out about the latest impromptu music session you can find out about the latest security incident you can find out about places of worship you can find out about the health centers you can feel the dynamism of this living breathing Community they also have their own News Network on YouTube with 36,000 viewers at the moment they are showing us what can be done with mobile digital Technologies they're showing that the magic of Technology can bring the invisible visible and they are giving a voice to themselves they are telling Their Own Story by bypassing the official narrative and we're seeing from All Points in the globe similar stories in Mongolia for instance where 30% of the people are notic SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns SMS is even used to hold herder Summits from remote participation and if people are migrating into urban and unfamiliar concrete environments they can also be helped in anticipation with social support that is ready and waiting for them based on SMS knowledge in Nigeria open source open- source SMS tools are being used by the redcross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria my colleague Jason Pete who runs this program tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things and not only is it empowering to the communities but really importantly this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term Health policies we are in a planet of 7 billion people 5 billion mobile subscriptions by 2015 there will be three billion smartphones in the world the UN Broadband commission has recently set targets to have Broadband access in 50% of the developing world compared to % today we are hurtling towards a hyperconnected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to Smart fast mobile devices people are understanding from Cairo to Oakland that there are new ways to come together there are new ways to mobilize there are new ways to influence a transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and the humanitarian models the collective voices of people needs to be more integrated through new technologies into the organizational strategies and plans of actions and not just recycled for fundraising or marketing we need to for example embrace the Big Data the knowledge that is there from Market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage Big Data one idea that I'd like you to consider for instance is to take a look at our it departments they're normally back room or basement Hardware service providers but they need to be elevated to software strategists we need people in our organizations who know what it's like to work with big data we need technology as a core organizational principle we need technological strategists in the boardroom who can ask and answer the question what would Amazon or Google do with all of this data and convert it into humanitarian good the possibilities that new digital Technologies are bringing can help humanitarian or organizations not only ensure that people's right to information is met or that they have their right to communicate but I think in the future humanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate the right for people to access critical communication Technologies in order to ensure that their voices are heard that they're truly participating that they're truly empowered in the humanitarian World it has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort we now have the tools we now have the possibilities there are no more reasons not to do it I believe we need to bring the humanitarian World from analog to digital thank you very   much"
"404, the story of a page not found - Renny Gleeson",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwvPaMolTFU,so what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it but to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is the 404 page is that it's that broken experience on the web it's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it and it serves you the 404 page it's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it and I just want you to think a little bit about remember for yourself it's annoying right when you hit this thing because it's the feeling of a broken relationship and that's where it's actually also interesting to think about where does 404 come from it's from a family of errors actually a whole set of relationship errors which when I was started digging into them it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couple's counselor you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey but before before yes but these things are everywhere they're on sites big they're on site small this is a global experience what a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this right you can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and things you know rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone a 404 page is not what you're looking for you get that and it's like a slap in the face like I'm just trying to think about how a 404 felt and it would be like if you if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and yet there's no skim milk and you say hey could you could you bring the skim milk and I walk out from behind the counter and they got no pants on and you're like oh I didn't want to see that that's that's the 404 feeling I mean I've heard about that so where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator we had eight startups sitting around there and those startups are focused on what they are not what they're not until one day a flee path which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes found this video no he's not okay all right they took that they took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and there was it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404 so this turned into a contest daily path had offers inspiration put inspiration on there 404 page stay hound which helps you find pet sitters through your social network commiserated with your pet right now each one of them found this it turned into a 24 hour contest at 404 the next day we gave out four hundred and four dollars in cash and what they learned was that those little things done right actually matter and at well-designed moments can build brands so you take a look out in the real world and you can the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself you can type in an earl and put in 404 and these open these will pop this is one that commiserate with you this is one that blames you this is one that I loved it said this is an error page but what if this error page was also an opportunity right so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be because back to the whole relationship issue what they figured out through exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not or it can remind me of why I should love you thank you
Hey science teachers -- make it fun - Tyler DeWitt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r3yGCq4InA,  let me tell you a story it's my first year as a new high school science teacher and I'm so eager I'm so excited I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans but I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything this happens one day I just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology viruses and how they attack and so I'm so excited to discuss this with them and I comment and I say can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool there's silence finally my favorite student she looks me straight in the eye and she says the reading sucked and then she clarifies she says you know what I don't mean that it sucks I mean that I didn't understand a word of it it's boring um who cares and it sucks these sympathetic Smiles spread all throughout the room though and I realized that all of my other students are in the same boat that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook but not one of them really understood the main ideas not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool why it's so important I'm totally clueless I have no idea what to do next so the only thing I can think of is say listen let me tell you a Story the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses these guys are blown up a couple million times the real bacteria and viruses are so small we can't see them without a microscope and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick but what a lot of people don't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick now the story that I start telling my kids it starts out like a Horror Story Once Upon a Time there's this happy little bacterium don't get too attach to him maybe he's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good maybe he ate something bad for lunch and then things get really horrible as his skin rips apart and he sees a virus coming out from his insides and then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides if ouch is right if you see this and you're a bacterium this is like your worst nightmare but if you're a virus and you see this you cross those little legs of yours and you think we rock because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this back bacterium here's what had to happen a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it the next thing is that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA and now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses because you see DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make so this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for Killer Robots the workers still come the next day they do their job but they're following different instructions so replacing the bacteria DNA with the virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses that is until it's so filled with by viruses that it bursts but that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria some are much more crafty when a secret agent virus infects a bacterium they do a little Espionage here this cloaked secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell but here's the kicker it doesn't do anything harmful not at first instead it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA and it just stays there like a terrorist Sleeper Cell waiting for instructions and what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies the babies also have the virus DNA in them so now we have whole extended bacteria family filled with virus sleeper cells they're just happily living together until a signal happens and Bam all of the DNA pops out it takes control of these cells turns them into virus making factories and they all burst a huge extended bacteria family all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts the viruses taking over the bacterium so now you understand how viruses can attack cells there are two ways on the left is what we call the liic way where the viruses go right in take over the cells on the left is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses so this stuff is not that hard right and now all of you understand it but if you've graduated from high school I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before but I W I bet it was presented in a way that it didn't exactly stick in your mind so when my students were first learning this why did they hate it so much well there were a couple reasons first of all I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn't have secret agent viruses and they didn't have horror stories you know in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness it kills me I'm not kidding I used to work for an educational publisher and as a writer I was always told never to use stories or fun engaging language because then my work might not be viewed as serious and scientific right I mean because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science so we have this field of science that's all about slime and color changes check this out and then we have of course as any good scientist has to have explosions but if a textbook seems too much fun it's somehow unscientific now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible if we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier we could start by saying something like these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium the way this showed up in the textbook it looked like this bacteria phage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium that's great perfect for 13 year olds but here's the thing there are plenty of people in Science Education who would look at this and say there's no way that we could ever give that to students because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate for example I told you that viruses have DNA well a very tiny fraction of them don't they have something called RNA instead so a professional science writer would Circle that and say that has to go we have to change it to something much more Technical and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation they'd find fault with almost every word I've used and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough and they'd have to change everything that wasn't 100% perfect then it would be accurate but it would be completely impossible to understand this is horrifying you know I keep talking about this idea of of telling a story and it's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyon of precision where you can't just tell a story it's like science has become that horrible Storyteller that we all know who gives us all the details nobody cares about we like oh I met my friend for lunch the other day and she was wearing these ugly jeans I mean they weren't really jeans they were more kind of like leggings but like I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings like but I think and you're just like oh my God what is the point or even worse Science Education is becoming like that guy who always says actually right you want to be like oh dude we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive 100 miles in total darkness and that guy's like actually it was 87.3 Miles and you're like actually shut up I'm just trying to tell a story because good storytelling is all about emotional connection we have to convince our audience that what we're talking about matters but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across I'm reminded of what the architect Mis vandero said and I paraphrase when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth I think the sentiment is particularly relevant to Science Education now finally I am uh I'm often so disappointed when people think that I'm advocating a dumbing down of science that's not true at all I'm currently a PhD student at MIT and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed specific scientific communication between experts but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds if a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science but if a young learner can't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this that will ruin their chances of success this needs to stop and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems and I beg them I beseech them to just stop it but I think that's unlikely so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up there's growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple understandable ways I dream of a Wikipedia likee website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler could understand and I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp the feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it's often written in lolcats but nonetheless it's so appreciative so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science there's still so much work left to be be done though and if you're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me pick up a camera start to write a blog whatever but leave out the seriousness leave out the jargon make me laugh make me care leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point how should you start why don't you say listen let me tell you a story thank  you
What’s the best country to live in?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqJcNnijmdQ,"What’s the best country  in the world to live in? Is it the one with the best food? The longest life expectancy? The best weather? For the past 70 years, most governments  have relied heavily on a single number to answer that question. This number influences elections,  the stock market, and government policy. But it was never intended for its current purpose; and some would argue that the world  is addicted to making it grow... forever. This number is called  the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and it was invented by the economist Simon Kuznets in the 1930s, to try and gauge the size of an economy in a single, easy to understand number. GDP is the total monetary value  of everything a country produces and sells on the market. To this day, GDP per capita, which is just the total GDP divided by the number of people living in that country, is widely seen as a measure of well-being. But GDP doesn’t actually say anything direct about well-being, because it doesn't take into account what a country produces or who has access to it. A million dollars of weapons contributes  the exact same amount to a country’s GDP as a million dollars of vaccines or food. The value society derives from things like public school or firefighters isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those services aren’t sold on the market. And if a country has a lot of wealth, but most of it is controlled by relatively few people, GDP per capita gives a distorted picture of how much money a typical person has. Despite all that, for a long time, higher GDP did correlate closely to a higher quality of life for people in many countries. From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled, tripled or even quadrupled in some western economies, people’s wages often grew proportionally. By the 1980s, this changed. Countries continued to grow richer, but wages stopped keeping pace  with GDP growth, or in some cases, even declined, and most of the benefits went to an  ever-smaller percentage of the population. Still, the idea of capturing a nation’s well-being in a single number had powerful appeal. In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk of Bhutan came up with the idea  of Gross National Happiness as an alternative  to Gross Domestic Product. Gross National Happiness is a metric  that factors in matters like health, education,  strong communities, and living standards, having citizens answer questions like, “How happy do you think your family members are at the moment?” “What is your knowledge of names of plants and wild animals in your area?” and “What type of day was yesterday?” The United Nations’ Human Development Index is a more widely used metric; it takes into account health and education, as well as income per capita  to estimate overall well-being. Meanwhile, a metric called the Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and the  environmental burdens of economic growth, again, boiling all this down to a single number. Though no country has been able to meet the basic needs of its people while also using resources  fully sustainably, Costa Rica currently comes the closest. Over the past few decades, it’s managed to grow its economy and improve living standards substantially without drastically increasing  its emissions. Other countries, like Colombia and Jordan, have made notable progress. Costa Rica now has better well-being outcomes like life expectancy than some of the world’s  richest countries. Ultimately, there are limits  to any approach that boils the quality of life in a country  down to a single number. Increasingly, experts favor a dashboard approach that lays out all the factors a single number obscures. This approach makes even more sense given  that people have different priorities, and the answer to which country  is best to live in depends on who’s asking the question. So what if that were you designing  your countries well-being metric? What do you value,  and what would you measure?"
Why can parrots talk? - Grace Smith-Vidaurre and Tim Wright,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EYUhpimyxc,"In 2010, a parrot that spoke  with the same British accent as his owner went missing. They were reunited four years later, but the intervening time left a conspicuous mark: the parrot had lost its British accent and was instead chattering away in Spanish. Parrots and several other birds are the only other animals that produce human speech. And some parrots do it almost  uncannily well. How is this possible? Most wild parrots are highly social. They use vocalizations for mating and territorial displays and to coordinate group movements. Some species have flocks  that continuously split and fuse, meaning individual parrots must be able to communicate with many others. Parrots use contact calls to interact and stay in touch when others are out of sight. But how exactly they use these calls depends on the species and the size of their flocks. Monk parakeets, for example, live in large colonies and have individualized contact calls  that help them stand out. Yellow-naped Amazon parrots,  on the other hand, forage in smaller groups that learn and share highly similar contact calls. This need for sophisticated mimicry may partially explain why yellow-naped Amazons and some other parrots can  closely imitate a wide range of sounds— including the human voice. So, how does a parrot actually declare that “Polly wants a cracker”? A person would string these sounds together using their larynx, the organ at the top of their windpipe. It consists of rings of muscles  and a vibrating membrane that controls airflow. They’d finely shape the vocalization  into enunciated words using their tongue and lips. For a parrot, however, the sound would originate in its syrinx, located at the base of its windpipe. Many other birds have two vibrating membranes within this organ. But parrots, like us, have just one. As sounds leave the airway, parrots shape them using their tongues and beaks. They can do this because they have especially flexible, powerful tongues that help them manipulate seeds and nuts. And while parrots’ beaks are rigid,  they have very flexible jaw joints, giving them a lot of control over how wide and how quickly they open their beaks. Like other animals  with learned vocalizations, parrot brains contain interconnected regions that allow them to hear, remember, modify,  and produce complex sounds. But while songbirds have just one song system in their brains, almost all parrots seem to have an additional circuit. Scientists think that this might give  them extra flexibility when it comes to learning the calls  of their own species— and ours. With this specialized anatomy, parrots can bark, scream, curse,  and recite factoids. One intrepid lost parrot managed  to get back home after repeating his full name  and address to helpful strangers. But these impressive abilities  raise another question: do parrots actually understand  what they’re saying? When most captive parrots talk, they’re likely attempting to form social bonds in the absence of their own species. Many probably have associations with words and may be drawn to ones  that elicit certain responses— hence their capacity for profanity. But, especially after training, parrots have been observed to say things in the appropriate contexts and assign meaning to words—  saying “goodnight” at the end of the day, asking for certain treats,  or counting and picking objects. One extensively trained  African grey parrot named Alex became the first non-human animal  to pose an existential question when he asked what color he was. Whether they’re belting Beyoncé, head-banging to classic rock, or rattling off cuss words at zoo-goers, parrots are constantly astounding us— as they have been for millennia. But our fascination with parrots has also made them vulnerable. Sought by poachers and pet traders, while losing their habitats to deforestation, wild populations have decreased dramatically. To truly understand parrots, we need  to preserve and study them in the wild."
What happens during a heart attack? - Krishna Sudhir,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_PYnWVoUzM,"Approximately 7 million people around the  world die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack, it can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls  of our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn into blockages. If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it in minutes, and a partially closed artery can become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off  to the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die within several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate in the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off. In the worst case scenario, a heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone is having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived  heart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing or vice-like. It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic as it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent in women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness may be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes, which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be  having a heart attack, the most important thing  is to respond quickly. If you have access to emergency medical services, call them. They're the fastest way  to get to a hospital. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin,  which opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack from getting worse. In the emergency room,  doctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's  electrical activity and a blood test to assess  heart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high-tech cardiac suite where tests are done  to locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen  the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon in a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal or polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require coronary artery bypass surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery from another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow around the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation to the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors both affect your risk. And the good news is that you can change your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet, and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity and strength training. A heart-healthy diet is low in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts and almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower  your heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also help prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low-dose aspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've already had a heart attack and for those known to be at high risk. And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common,  but they don't have to be inevitable.

"1000 TEDTalks, 6 words - Sebastian Wernicke",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5pklFtGthY,"there's currently over a thousand TEDTalks on the Ted website and I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic except for me I don't agree with this I think we have a situation here because if you think about it 1,000 TED talks that's over 1000 ideas worth spreading how on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand Ted videos it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so and I did a little calculation of this the damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000 so having seen this danger to the economy I thought we need to find a solution to this problem here's my approach to it all if you look at the current situation you have a thousand TEDTalks each of those TED Talks has an average length of about two thousand and three hundred words now take this together and you end up with 2.3 million words of TED Talks which is about three Bibles worth of content the obvious question here is does a TED talk really need two thousand and three hundred words isn't there something shorter I mean if you have an idea of spreading surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words the only question is how short can you get what's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TED talk while I was pondering this question I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway who allegedly said that these six words here for sale baby shoes never worn where the best novel he had ever written and I also encountered a project called six word memoirs where people were even asked to take your whole life and please sum this up into six words such as this year found true love married someone else or living an existential vacuum it sucks we like that one so if a novel can be put into six words and a whole memoir can be put into six words you don't need more than six words for a TED talk we could have been done by lunch here and if you did this for all thousand TEDTalks he will get from 2.3 million words down to six thousand so I thought this was quite worthwhile so I started asking all my friends please take your favorite TED talk and put that into six words so here are some of the results that I received I think they're quite nice for example Dan Pink's talk of motivation which was pretty good if you haven't seen it drop carat drop stick bring meaning it's what he's basically talking about in those 18 and a half minutes or some even included references to the speakers such as Nathan Myhrvold speaking style or the one of of Tim Ferriss which might be considered a bit strenuous at times the challenge here is if I try to systematically do this I would probably end up with a lot of summaries but not with many friends in the end so I had to find a different method I had preferably involving total strangers and luckily there's a website for that called Mechanical Turk which is a website where you can post tasks that you don't want to do yourself such as please summarize this text for me in six words and I didn't allow any low cost countries to work on this but I found out I could get a six word summary for just ten cents which i think is a pretty good price even then unfortunately it's not possible to summarize each TED talk individually because if you do the math you know you have a thousand TEDTalks you pay 10 cents each you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks because some of them will probably or are really bad so I would end up paying hundreds of dollars so I thought of a different way by thinking well the talks revolve around certain themes so what if I don't let people summarize individual TED Talks - six words but give them ten TED talks at the same time and say please do a six word summary for that one I would cut my costs by 90% so for $60 I could summarize a thousand TEDTalks into just 600 summaries which would actually be quite nice now some of you might actually right now be thinking it's downright crazy to have 10 TED talks summarized into just six words but it's actually not because there's an example by a statistics professor Hans Rosling I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks he's got eight talks online and those eight talks can basically be summed up into just four words because that's all he's basically showing us our intuition is really bad always proves us wrong so people on the internet some didn't do so well I mean when when I asked him to summarize the tenth ethics at the same time some took the easy route out you know they just had some general comment others and there were others and I found this quite cheeky they used their six words to talk back to me and asked me if I'd been too much on Google lately and finally also I did never understood this you know some people really they came up with their own wording of the truth I mean I I don't know any TED talk that kind of contains this but oh well in the end however and this is really amazing for each of those ten tetra clusters that I submitted I actually received meaningful summaries here are some of my favorites for example for all the TED Talks around food someone summed this up into food shaping body brains and environment which i think is pretty good or happiness driving toward happiness moving toward unhappiness so here I was I had started out with a thousand TED talks and I had six hundred six word summaries for those actually it sounded nice in the beginning but when you look at six hundred summary so it's quite a lot it's a huge list so I thought you know I probably have to take this one step further here and kind of create summaries of the summaries and this is exactly what I did so I took the six hundred summaries that I had put them into nine groups according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on ted.com and asked people to do summaries of those again there were some misunderstandings for example when I had a cluster of all the beautiful talks someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pickup line here but in the end amazingly again people were able to do it for anxiety aesthetics people dying or people suffering there was also one with easy solutions around or the recipe for the ultimate draw dropping TED talk Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer I mean that's the essence of it all now I had my nine groups but I mean it's already quite a reduction but of course now once you're that for it you're not really satisfied I mean I wanted to go all the way all the way down the Distillery you know starting out with a thousand TEDTalks I wanted to have a thousand TEDTalks summarized into just six words which would be a 99.999 seven percent reduction in content and I would only pay ninety nine dollars and fifty so stay even below a hundred dollars for it so add 50 overall summaries done this time I paid 25 cents because I thought the task was a bit harder and unfortunately when I first received the answers and here you see six of the answers I was a bit disappointed because I think you'll agree they all summarized some aspect of Ted by to me that kind of felt felt a bit bland or they just had a certain aspect of Ted in them so I was almost ready to give up when one night I played around with these sentences and found out that there's actually a beautiful solution in here so here it is a crowd-sourced six word summary of a thousand TEDTalks at the value of ninety nine dollars and fifteen why the worry I'd rather wonder thank you very much"
Sometimes it's good to give up the driver's seat - Baba Shiv,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpHTd4WX0vI,I want to start on us slightly somber note 2007 five years ago my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2b now looking back the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits these are very painful for my wife understandably so it is not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer there's 39 years old absolutely no history of cancer in her family the most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions of her decisions that were being trussed upon us should it be a mastic to me should it be a lobectomy should it be a more aggressive form of treatment given the Ricoh stage to be with all the side-effects or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment and these were being thrust upon us by the doctors now you can ask this question why would the doctors doing this now a simplistic answer would be the doctors are doing this because you know they want to protect themselves legally I think that is too simplistic these are well-meaning doctors some of them have gone on to become very good friends they probably simply following the wisdom that has come down the ages this adage that when you're making decisions especially decisions of importance it's best to be in charge it's best to be in control it's best to be in the driver's seat and we were certainly in the driver's seat making all these decisions so let me tell you some of you have been there it's the most agonizing and harrowing experience which got me thinking said is there any validity to this this whole adage that when you're making decisions it's best to take the driver's seat be in charge be in control or are there contexts where we're far better off taking the passenger seat and have someone else drive for example a trusted financial advisor could be a trusted doctor exactly and since I was I study human decision-making I said I'm going to run some studies to find some answers and I'm going to share one of these studies with you today so imagine that all of you our participant in this study I'm going to tell you that what you're going to do in this study is you're going to drink a cup of tea if you're wondering why I'll tell you why in a few seconds from now you are going to solve a series of puzzles and I'm going to show you examples of these puzzles in momentarily and the more puzzles you solve the greater the chance is that you win some prizes now what do you have to consume the deep why because it makes a lot of sense in order to solve these puzzles effectively if you think about it your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously right it needs to be alert for which caffeine is very good simultaneously it needs to be calm not agitated calm for which chamomile is very good now comes the between subject design the a be designed the a/b testing so what I'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups so imagine that there's an imaginary line out here so everyone here will be group a and we're not here would be group B now for you folks what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas and I'm asking you I can go ahead and ask you to choose your team so you can choose what your tea you want does that what is your mental state okay I'm going to chose the caffeinated tea I'm going to choose the combative she's going to be in charge you're going to be in control you're going to be in the driver's seat you folks I'm going to show you these two teas but you don't have a choice I'm going to give you one of these two teas and keep in mind I'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you and you know that so if you think about it this is an extreme case scenario because the real world whenever you are taking the passenger seat very often the driver is going to be someone you trust an expert etcetera so there's an extreme case scenario now you're all going to consume the tea so imagine that you're taking the tree now we'll wait for you to finish the tea we'll give you another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects now you're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles here's an example of the puzzle you're gonna solve anyone in the audience want to take a stab whoa okay that's cool yeah so what we do if we had you who will get the answer as far as as a participant we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise because we want these puzzles to be difficult these are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say chi'lan and then you'll have to unstick yourself right so these have been calibrated to your level of expertise because we want this to be difficult and tell you why momentarily now here's how the example any one's much more difficult yeah Wow okay so yeah so this is again difficult you'll say camber then you have to go make her and all that and then you can unstuck yourself okay so you have 30 minutes now you solve these 15 puzzles now the question we are asking here is in terms of the outcome and come to the number of puzzles solved will you in the driver's seat end up solving more puzzles because you were in control you could decide which key you would choose or would you be better off in terms of the number of puzzles salt and systematically what we will share across a series of studies is that you the passengers even though the tea was picked for you at random will end up solving more puzzles than you the drivers will also observe another thing and that is you folks not here solving for your puzzles you're also putting less juice into the task less effort you're less persistent and so on how do we know that but we have two objective measures one is what is a time on average or taking in attempting to solve these puzzles you will spend less time compared to you second you have 30 minutes to solve this are you taking the entire 30 minutes are you giving up before the 30 minutes elapse you will be more likely to give up before the 30 minute collapses come at you so you're putting in less juice and therefore the outcome fewer puzzles solved brings us now do why does this happen right and under what situations when would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better more favorable outcomes to the driver it all has to do with when you face what I call the income it's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting after you made the decision so if you think about it in this particular puzzle pass it could happen in investing in the stock market very volatile out there it could be in a medical situation the feedback here is immediate you know the feedback for they're solving the puzzles are not right second it is negative they remember the deck was stacked against you in terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles now this can happen in the medical domain for example very early on the treatment things are negative the feedback before things become positive right there happen in the stock market volatile stock market getting the negative feedback it is also immediate and the feedback in all these cases is concrete it's not ambiguous you know if you're solve the puzzles or not now the added one apart from this immediacy negative this concreteness now you have a sense of agency you were responsible for your decision so what do you do you focus on the forgone option you say you know what I should have chosen the other team that casts your decision in doubt reduces the confidence you have in the decision it is the confidence you have in the performance performance in terms of solving the puzzles and therefore less juice into the task fewer puzzles solve less favorable outcomes come back to you folks and this can happen in the medical domain if you think about it right a patient of the driver see for example unless juice which means you know you know keeping herself or himself less physically fit physically active to hasten the recovery process which is what is often advocated you probably wouldn't do that and therefore there are times when you're facing the inka when the feedback there's going to be immediate negative concrete and you have the sense of agency where you're far better off taking the passenger seat and how someone else drive now I started off on the somber note I want to finish up on a more upbeat note it has now been five years suck in more than five years and the good news thank god is that is the cancer is still in remission so it all ends well but one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment my wife and I decided that we will take the passenger seat and that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that we could focus on her recovery we let the doctors make all the decisions take the driver's seat thank you
Networking for the networking averse - Lisa Green Chau,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=garadDEgkwU,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar It's that time again. You need another internship to bolster your college applications. Last year you worked at a local art museum, helping organize their collection and giving tours to visitors. This year, it's going to be much more difficult. You want to work on an organic farm across the country in California. That's your real passion. Unfortunately, your friends' list of contacts doesn't include organic farmers. The same for your parents' group of friends. They want to help you, but they simply don't know of any internships in agriculture. The school counselor, she just laughed. To make your farming dreams come true, you're going to have to press beyond your strong ties, people like your family and closest friends, and try tapping into your weaker ties. Weak ties are a broader network, your friends of friends of friends. They're important because they have access to resources that your strong ties don't have. This works in both directions, by the way - you have access to resources that they don't have. Let's say most people speak to three close friends on a regular basis. Each time you reach beyond the next degree of contacts, you have access to three more people, like a tree that branches out three times per node, so you can look beyond your closest circles. During the last family get-together, didn't you hear that your aunt's friend studied lighting with a nature photographer on the West Coast? In fact, you recall this because you saw a recent image by said photographer on the front cover of The New York Times. So, you email him and learn that the photographer's wife's cousin publishes a sustainability magazine, which employs a staff writer who pitches on a local baseball team with an umpire who, wait for it, is an organic farmer. Bingo! Get ready to trade in those cuff links for some apple seeds, all because you reached out to your weak ties. That's your key, remember? Every conversation is an opportunity. Moreover, don't wait for opportunity, make it happen. Take Kathryn Minshew for example. She went from not knowing anyone at Yahoo to three warm introductions to major executives in 30 days. Here are her suggestions for three steps to networking. 1 - Always say yes to invitations, even if it's not clear what you'll get out of the meeting. Many of Kathryn's most productive relationships resulted from a meeting or call without a clear agenda. 2 - When you want something, broadcast it to everyone you meet. That doesn't mean you beg everyone for help as soon as you meet them, but talk about what you're trying to do. Be excited, ask for feedback, and try to get them excited too. 3 - Show up and often. Be at the forefront of other's minds when opportunities arise. You don't want to be that person who only shows up when he needs something. Be the one that people think of and want to reach out to when a new opportunity presents itself. So while networking may not be the most intuitive, or even for some of you introverts, the most comfortable skill, it's a helpful tool to have as you think about getting a job, going to school, or most importantly, learning from others. Good luck!"
Making a TED-Ed Lesson: Two ways to animate slam poetry,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onZEkLpQ0FA,"In this short video, we're going to show you how we use two different animation techniques, both rotoscoping and traditional hand-drawn animation in the TED-Ed Lesson, ""Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry: A Lesson of Transformation."" A poetry slam is a competition in which poets are judged on their poems, often for qualities of emotional power and lyrical resonance. Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley, a veteran slam poet who spent decades teaching children to express themselves through spoken words, a Lesson, which offers a guide to creating poetry with immediacy and power, also serves as a great example of exactly that. It's a story told in the form of a poem that packs a real emotional punch. She introduces Tyler, who's sitting in an 11th grade writing class, struggling with the assignment of having to write a poem based on a personal experience. The story is told from two perspectives, one external and one internal. Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage of the outside world, and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan performs Tyler's inner voice. To set these two realms of inner- and outer-experience apart, a different animation technique was used to illustrate each. The real world was animated by rotoscoping, with a frame-by-frame tracing of live-action footage in black and white line art. The animation depicting the inner-stream of consciousness world of Tyler's memories was traditionally drawn on paper, featured watercolored backgrounds and a more expressionistic design. Once deciding on this general approach, the project went right into pre-production. In animation, pre-production is the planning stage. It's all the decisions that need to be made before going and actually making the thing in its final form. This can include developing the look or design of the piece, experimenting with colors and camera angles, revising the script, and so on. All these decisions are important because they determine how much work and time the production will take. Extra time spent here figuring things out can often save a lot of time down the road. For our project, a storyboard was first created, in which the framing, composition, and imagery for each shot was determined. Then an animatic was made, which is basically a movie of the storyboard. This helped us figure out the timing of each shot. It also helped us get an idea of how well everything would flow together visually between our rotoscoped and traditionally animated scenes once they were assembled. For the rotoscoped shots, we first had to create the live action footage to be traced. Working with what we had in our humble office, we created a classroom of desks using only one small table. We shot this multiple times from each angle the storyboard called for, each time with a different volunteer from among our co-workers. Our source footage elements then needed to be composited, or assembled and arranged together, before we could rotoscope them. A composite is a special effects term for a shot that combines two or more elements in it that were created separately. To do this, we used After Effects, a digital compositing and motion graphics program. The first step was to isolate the part of the frame we needed by masking off the unnecessary negative space, or parts of the frame we didn't need. The individual shots were then each layered into one composite shot, resized and arranged appropriately to create the illusion of them all being there in perspective at the same time. Every third frame was then exported as an image sequence, ready to be rotoscoped. The tracing was done digitally, drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor. The rest of the animation was done by hand on paper. Unlike rotoscoping, here the timing and motion of the animation was all planned out by the animator ahead of time. An appropriate number of drawings were then done to accomplish the movement. Each animation drawing is then scanned, registered, and sequenced together in the computer. That animation sequence is then composited with the layered background art. Camera moves are then plotted out and executed. One way that poetry uses language to communicate emotions and ideas is through the use of metaphor. ""Mama's lies are footsteps too many to count making excuses on black snow."" Animation's a medium that's also uniquely well-suited to communicating emotions and ideas through visual metaphor. Applying the dual techniques of rotoscoped and traditional animation, each with their own inherent looks, allowed us to visually represent the dual nature of the creative process described in the Lesson. There's the internal aspect of experience and memory, which is mined for inspiration, and there's the external aspect of revealing it to the world through a structured presentation. We combined both techniques for the last shots of Tyler delivering his poem to the world, allowing us to convey in a direct, visual way the power of that moment of communication when internal becomes external, which, in both poetry and animation, is where the magic happens."
Can you solve the fish riddle? -  Steve Wyborney,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLOALyWls2k,"You are the cargo director on the maiden voyage of the S.S. Buoyant, and you've agreed to transport several tanks containing the last specimens of a critically endangered fish species to their new aquarium. Unfortunately, as you're passing through shark-infested waters, the boat is battered by a fierce storm, throwing your precious cargo overboard. And to make matters worse, no one seems certain just how many fish tanks are missing. Fortunately, you have a rescue sub at your disposal, but only enough fuel for one trip to the ocean floor. You need to know where the tanks are so you can gather them all in one quick pass. Not a single fish can be lost. You decide to scan the three sectors of the ocean floor where the cargo could have landed. Thermal imaging shows 50 organisms in the area, and you quickly realize that that number includes both your fish and some ravenous sharks. You flip on the sonar  to get a better look. The image for Sector Alpha shows four tanks and two sharks, the image for Sector Beta shows two tanks and four sharks, and the image for Sector Gamma is blank. Your sonar has malfunctioned, and you're going to have to go with the info you have. You check the shipping notes, but all you learn is that each tank had the same number of fish inside. The cargo hold had space for anywhere from 1 to 13 total tanks. And finally, the old captain tells you that this area has the odd property that no two sectors can have the same number of sharks, but every sector will have at least one, and no more than seven. There's no time to waste. The tanks won't withstand the pressure much longer. As you descend in the sub, you review everything you know. How many fish tanks do you need to find in Sector Gamma? Hurry, the fate of an entire species depends on you. Pause here if you want  to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first, it seems like there are just too many missing pieces of information. After all, you don't know how many fish or how many tanks there are, let alone how many fish are in each one. But then you remember the best way to compare multiple pieces  of partial information - a table. Since we know there are thirteen tanks at most, and we already see six tanks in Sectors Alpha and Beta, we know the total number of tanks must be between 6 and 13. We also know that each sector has  a different amount of sharks with no more than seven in each one. Since there are two in Sector Alpha and four in Sector Beta, Sector Gamma can have  1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 sharks. What about the number of endangered fish? Out of the 50 total organisms in all three sectors, we know at least seven are sharks, leaving a maximum of 43 fish inside all the tanks. And the more sharks we find in Sector 3, the fewer fish there are to save. Now, remember that the fish are equally distributed across all the tanks. Why is that important? Because it means that one of the possible values for the total amount of fish must be divisible by one of the possible values for the total amount of tanks. And looking at the table, we can see that the only combination that works is 39 fish divided between 13 tanks with three fish in each. With sharks swarming around, you quickly pilot the sub through the first two sectors before retrieving the remaining seven tanks in Sector Gamma. You've saved the species and taken an impromptu dive. All in all, not a bad day, unless you happen to be a hungry shark."
Test yourself: Can you tell the difference between music and noise? - Hanako Sawada,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsY-WfoKy80,"In 1960, American composer John Cage  went on national television to share his latest work. But rather than employing traditional instruments, Cage appeared surrounded  by household clutter, including a bathtub, ice cubes, a toy fish, a pressure cooker, a rubber duck, and several radios. Armed with these tools and a stopwatch, he performed “Water Walk,” setting off a series of sounds with a serious expression and incredible precision. Some viewers found the performance hysterical, while others thought it was completely absurd. But most people watching likely shared  the same question: is this even music? This question is harder to answer than you might think. What we determine as music often depends on our expectations. For example, imagine you’re  in a jazz club listening to the rhythmic honking of horns. Most people would agree that this is music. But if you were on the highway hearing the same thing, many would call it noise. After all, car horns aren’t instruments and these drivers aren’t  musicians... right? Expectations like these influence how we categorize everything we hear. We typically think something sounds  more musical if it uses a recognizable structure  or popular sounds arranged in well-known patterns. And even within the realm of music, we expect certain genres to use specific instruments and harmonies. These expectations are based  on existing musical traditions, but those traditions aren't set in stone. They vary across different cultures and time periods. And in the early 20th century, when many artists were pushing  the boundaries of their fields, John Cage wanted to discover  what new kinds of music might exist beyond those constraints. He began pioneering new instruments that blurred the lines between art and everyday life, and used surprising objects to reinvent existing instruments. He also explored new ways for music to mingle with other art forms. He and his creative and romantic partner, Merce Cunningham, held recitals where Cage’s music and Cunningham’s choreography would be created independently before being performed together. But whatever his approach, Cage gleefully dared listeners to question the boundaries between music and noise, as well as sound and silence. Perhaps the best example is one of Cage’s most famous compositions— a solo piano piece consisting of nothing but musical rests for four minutes and 33 seconds. This wasn’t intended as a prank, but rather, as a question. Could the opening and closing of a piano lid be music? What about the click of a stopwatch? The rustling, and perhaps even the complaining, of a crowd? Like the white canvases of his painting peers, Cage asked the audience to question  their expectations about what music was. And while the piece didn’t evoke the drama of some traditional compositions, it certainly elicited a strong emotional response. Cage’s work frequently prioritized these spontaneous, ephemeral experiences over precise, predictable performances. He even developed processes that left some compositional decisions up to chance. One of his favorite such systems was the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text. Using just a handful of coins, the I Ching allows readers  to produce a pattern of lines which can be interpreted to answer questions and offer fortunes. But Cage adapted these patterns into a series of tables that generated different musical  durations, tempos, and dynamics. Eventually, he even used early computers to help produce these random parameters. For some pieces, Cage went even further, offering musicians incomplete compositions notated with broad instructions, allowing them to compose on the fly with the help of his guidelines. Some composers rejected Cage's seemingly careless approach. They believed it was the composer’s job  to organize sound and time for a specific, intentional purpose. After all, if these strange compositions  were music, then where do we draw the line? But like a bold explorer, Cage didn't want to be bound by restrictions, and he certainly didn't want to follow old rules. He dedicated himself to shattering our expectations, creating a series of once in a lifetime experiences that continue encouraging  musicians and audiences to embrace the unexpected."
"Who were Las Mariposas, and why were they murdered? - Lisa Krause",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e7bhUjUEJ8,"From 1930 to 1961, thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured, and murdered under Rafael Trujillo’s dictatorship  in the Dominican Republic. Three sisters would go on to lead  an underground revolution. But while their courage inspired many, it threatened the man in power, and their lives would come  to a tragic early end. Trujillo rose through the military ranks  during the United States’ occupation of the Dominican Republic. He assumed power in 1930 through a coup and rigged election and created a system that enriched  himself and his allies. Trujillo’s family alone  controlled three-fifths of the country’s gross domestic product, including monopolies  over salt, beef, and newspapers. He renamed the country's capital after himself and expected his portrait to be displayed in every household. And he committed atrocities, including  the massacre of thousands of Haitians. All the while, a secret police force maintained his power by targeting opponents at home and abroad. The Mirabal sisters grew up in a middle class family in the countryside. Their parents sent the four sisters— Patria, Dedé, Minerva, and María Teresa— to one of the country’s  best boarding schools. There, Minerva met a classmate whose relative was killed on Trujillo's orders. She began seeking out strong voices of opposition and discussing issues of oppression and justice with her sisters. While Dedé stayed out of politics, Minerva, Patria, and María Teresa became invested in changing their country. However, the Mirabal family’s  safe standing soon collapsed. In 1949, they were invited  to one of Trujillo’s parties, which served as his personal hunting grounds for young women. Declining the invitation was not an option. Despite Minerva’s attempts  to avoid him at the reception, she eventually danced with Trujillo but rejected his advances. The Mirabal family left the party early, which was seldom done and considered disrespectful to the dictator. Their father, Enrique, was imprisoned and family property was confiscated. Minerva graduated with highest honors as one of the first women in the country  to receive a law degree. But she was denied state authorization to practice— a process Trujillo oversaw. While studying, Minerva met  Manolo Tavárez Justo. He shared her political convictions and the two married in 1955. They watched as armed revolutions launched throughout Latin America. After Trujillo crushed an attempt to overthrow him in 1959, they began to prepare a revolution of their own. The Mirabal sisters and their husbands formed the June 14th movement along with many others  from the middle class. Codenamed Las Mariposas,  or the Butterflies, the three sisters organized  and attended clandestine meetings and distributed pamphlets detailing Trujillo’s violations. In January of 1960, they called representatives together  from all over the country to establish the movement’s structure  and prepare an uprising. But it was not to be. Trujillo had spies everywhere. Soon, many revolutionaries, including Minerva and María Teresa, were arrested. During this time, Patria found creative ways of transmitting information to and from imprisoned rebels. Fearful of losing the support of the U.S. and the Church, which had recently begun to criticize him, Trujillo released the sisters while leaving their husbands imprisoned. But they continued to threaten  his regime’s stability— and his ego. On November 25th, as the three sisters were returning from  visiting two of their imprisoned husbands, Trujillo’s men stopped their car. The sisters, along with their driver, Rufino de la Cruz, were asphyxiated and beaten to death. The men rolled the Jeep off a hill  to frame the murder as a car accident. Patria was 36, Minerva was 33, and María Teresa was 25. But Trujillo's plan to silence the Mirabal sisters and stabilize his regime  backfired. Much of the public wasn’t fooled by the flimsy coverup. The international community condemned the assassination. And the U.S. closed its Dominican embassy and secretly invested  in the anti-Trujillo movement. Months later, former members  of the Dominican military killed the dictator, bringing his violent, 31-year reign to an end. Thanks to their family, especially their surviving sister, Dedé, the legacy of the Mirabal sisters would  surpass the clutches of Trujillo’s tyranny even long after their deaths. Today, the Mirabal sisters are national heroes with monuments and honors  commemorating their struggle. In 1999, the United Nations declared November 25th, the anniversary of their deaths, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Their courageous fight for justice has inspired generations."
Feedback loops: How nature gets its rhythms - Anje-Margriet Neutel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inVZoI1AkC8,"Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform, feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature, feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound, the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called  a feedback loop. And the natural world is full  of these mechanisms formed by the links between living  and nonliving things that build resilience by governing  the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter, providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die, the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow, and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops can also be harmful, like when removing a forest  makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil, and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares, they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing  the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of  our pesticides. Note that each feedback is the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not  of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect, occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered  cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems play together, creating regular patterns just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated  by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud, with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the  turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest, with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their  ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into a magnificent orchestra."
Why do you want to squeeze cute things? - Joshua Paul Dale,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxsoE3jO8HM,"Watching a kitten fumbling around, it might feel as if you’ve never encountered anything so devastatingly adorable in your mortal life. You may want to pet its soft fur and kiss its tiny head. But you may also feel the conflicting urge to squeeze or smush the kitten, maybe even stuff it in your mouth. However, you don’t. And you might be appalled by yourself. But this urge, which psychologists call “cute aggression,” is a surprisingly common one estimated to affect about half of all adults. To better understand this peculiar phenomenon, let's start with what cuteness is. In 1943, one scientist created  a baby schema that identified key features associated with cuteness, like plump cheeks, large eyes, and short limbs. These characteristics,  associated with many young animals, were placed in opposition with those  perceived as less cute. Decades of study have since indicated  that this baby schema reliably tracks with how people perceive cuteness. When study participants see images containing more features that the baby schema pinpoints as cute, they tend to look at them longer and more often. And the photos appear  to stimulate brain regions associated with emotion and reward. Cuteness is also thought to influence behavior. In a 2009 study, participants performed better at the game Operation— which demands precise, careful movements— when shown cute images beforehand. The results of another study indicated that people use recycling bins more when they have cute images on them. And the fact that cuteness hijacks  our emotions is certainly not lost  on authorities and advertisers. But why does cuteness  have this hold on us? It's nearly impossible to know for sure, but one theory is that cute things simply make us want to nurture them. Because human babies are relatively helpless on their own, it’s hypothesized that evolution favored infants who were perceived as cute and inspired more care and interaction. And, being acutely sensitive to cuteness, we're tuned into similar features in other species. In fact, as we domesticated animals,  their appearances tended to change too. Some scientists have noted a phenomenon called “domestication syndrome,” where certain animals appear to have gradually adopted more juvenile features as they became more docile. One theory is that these  physical changes are regulated by an embryonic structure  called the neural crest. It helps determine how some  of a developing embryo’s cells differentiate and where they go. Delaying or inhibiting the arrival of  these cells in certain areas of the body can result in an underdevelopment  of the pituitary and adrenal glands, which govern fear and aggression. It can also lead  to physical characteristics like floppier ears, shorter snouts, and smaller jaws. This is one idea of how selecting  for behavioral characteristics like friendliness, may also select  for more juvenile, cuter physical traits. Basically, as humans bred  and domesticated docile dogs, we seem to have made some breeds look more like babies. Some scientists theorize that we may have even domesticated ourselves. The thinking here is that  as ancient humans formed larger, more cooperative groups, they selected for friendlier individuals. This may have then led to some  of the physical characteristics that distinguish us from our closest evolutionary cousins, like smaller, rounder skulls and subtler brow ridges. But if cuteness is related to nurturing and decreased aggression, why would anyone ever want  to squeeze or bite cute things? Well, cute aggression  is importantly not linked to the actual intention to do harm. Instead, it seems to result from emotional overload. Some scientists think that cute things elicit such positive emotions from certain people that the experience becomes overwhelming. They hypothesize that slightly aggressive, discordant thoughts are the brain’s way of putting the brakes  on and regulating those intense feelings— not getting you to actually eat a kitten. Cuteness can come off as a frivolous, innocent quality, but it wields immense,  consequential power. Not to be aggressive, but cuteness kind of runs the world."
Who am I? A philosophical inquiry - Amy Adkins,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHwVyplU3Pg,"Throughout the history of mankind, three little words have sent poets to the blank page, philosophers to the Agora, and seekers to the oracles: ""Who am I?"" From the ancient Greek aphorism inscribed on the Temple of Apollo, ""Know thyself,"" to The Who's rock anthem, ""Who Are You?"" philosophers, psychologists, academics, scientists, artists, theologians and politicians have all tackled the subject of identity. Their hypotheses are widely varied and lack significant consensus. These are smart, creative people, so what's so hard about coming up with the right answer? One challenge certainly lies with the complex concept  of the persistence of identity. Which you is who? The person you are today? Five years ago? Who you'll be in 50 years? And when is ""am""? This week? Today? This hour? This second? And which aspect of you is ""I""? Are you your physical body? Your thoughts and feelings? Your actions? These murky waters of abstract logic are tricky to navigate, and so it's probably fitting that to demonstrate the complexity, the Greek historian Plutarch used the story of a ship. How are you ""I""? As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical founder King of Athens, single-handedly slayed  the evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship. To honor this heroic feat, for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly maintained his ship in the harbor, and annually reenacted his voyage. Whenever a part of the ship was worn or damaged, it was replaced with an identical piece of the same material until, at some point,  no original parts remained. Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus was an example  of the philosophical paradox revolving around  the persistence of identity. How can every single part  of something be replaced, yet it still remains the same thing? Let's imagine there are two ships: the ship that Theseus  docked in Athens, Ship A, and the ship sailed by the Athenians 1000 years later, Ship B. Very simply, our question is this: does A equal B? Some would say that for 1000 years there has been only one Ship of Theseus, and because the changes made to it happened gradually, it never at any point in time stopped being the legendary ship. Though they have absolutely  no parts in common, the two ships are numerically identical, meaning one and the same, so A equals B. However, others could argue that Theseus never set foot on Ship B, and his presence on the ship is an essential qualitative property of the Ship of Theseus. It cannot survive without him. So, though the two ships  are numerically identical, they are not qualitatively identical. Thus, A does not equal B. But what happens  when we consider this twist? What if, as each piece  of the original ship was cast off, somebody collected them all, and rebuilt the entire original ship? When it was finished, undeniably two physical ships would exist: the one that's docked in Athens, and the one in some guy's backyard. Each could lay claim to the title, ""The Ship of Theseus,"" but only would could actually be the real thing. So which one is it, and more importantly,  what does this have to do with you? Like the Ship of Theseus, you are a collection of constantly changing parts: your physical body, mind, emotions, circumstances, and even your quirks, always changing, but still in an amazing and sometimes illogical way, you stay the same, too. This is one of the reasons that  the question, ""Who am I?"" is so complex. And in order to answer it, like so many great minds before you, you must be willing to dive into the bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox. Or maybe you could just answer, ""I am a legendary hero sailing  a powerful ship on an epic journey."" That could work, too."
The infamous overpopulation bet: Simon vs. Ehrlich - Soraya Field Fiorio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw2mn40BVo0,"In 1980, two American professors bet $1,000 on a question with stakes  that couldn’t be higher: would the earth run out of resources  to sustain a growing human population? One of them was Stanford biologist  Paul Ehrlich, who wrote the bestselling 1968 book, “The Population Bomb.” The global population had grown rapidly since World War II, and Ehrlich predicted that millions would starve to death as the population increased faster than the food supply. He drew from the ideas of 18th century economist Thomas Malthus and related work from the 20th century. Malthus had posited  that population growth, if unchecked over time,  would always outpace food supply. Through the 1970s,  it seemed like Ehrlich was right: famines, pollution, and political unrest had many concerned that humanity  was on the brink of such a crisis, and some governments considered  and even implemented policies to limit population growth. Betting against Ehrlich was Julian Simon, a professor of business and economics. He analyzed historic data from around the world, and found no correlation  between a growing population and a decrease in standards of living— in fact, he found the opposite. He argued that Ehrlich’s work, and that of Malthus before him, was based on theoretical calculations, while the real-world data told a different story. But then, he departed  from the data himself, claiming human ingenuity would always find alternatives to compensate for diminishing resources. If that seems overly optimistic to you, well, you're not alone. Ehrlich and other experts found  Simon’s claims preposterous. In June 1980, Simon wrote a scathing  article for Science Magazine that incited a heated debate of published  articles between the two men. Simon said he should have placed a wager against Ehrlich years before, when Ehrlich ventured that, “England would not exist  in the year 2000.” Later that year,  Simon called Ehrlich a false prophet and challenged him to a bet. Their feud also touched on the debate about whether to prioritize environmental protections or economic growth, a key issue in the American presidential race between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. After some debate, they set the final terms: $200 on the price of each of five metals. If the price of the metal decreased  or held steady over the next decade, Simon won. If the price increased, Ehrlich won. Wait, what? Weren’t we talking  about overpopulation and famine? What could the price of metals possibly have to do with that? Well, the reality is that the price of metals may not have been the best choice— many factors impact these prices that have nothing to do with overpopulation. But their reasoning was as follows:  metals are finite natural resources used in all sorts of manufacturing. Ehrlich believed a growing population  would consume such finite resources, and scarcity would drive the prices up. Simon thought humanity would find substitutes for the metals, and the prices would stay stable  or even decrease. So, what happened? The world population continued  to increase over the next 10 years, but the price of all five metals  decreased, making Simon the clear winner of a bet that may not have been a great proxy for the question they were debating, anyway. As for the question itself, today, their focus on overpopulation represent a snapshot of history. Our understanding of what causes starvation and famine has progressed: we have the resources to support a growing human population, but we’re currently failing to distribute those resources equitably, and changing that should be our priority. And we no longer see population size  as a primary cause of environmental degradation  and climate change, or limiting population growth  as a viable solution to these problems. Rather, experts largely agree that our focus should be on replacing unsustainable technologies and practices with sustainable ones, and that economic growth  and environmental protections don’t have to be at odds. In October 1990, Julian Simon  received a check from Paul Ehrlich. There was no note."
When is water safe to drink? - Mia Nacamulli,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G244Q4AGJ7U,"Take a look at the water in this glass. Refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable to your survival. Before you take a sip, though, how do you know that the water inside is free from disease-causing organisms and pollutants? One out of ten people in the world can't actually be sure that their water is clean  and safe to drink. Why is that? Inadequate sanitation, poor protection of drinking water sources, and improper hygiene often lead to sewage  and feces-contaminated water. That's the ideal breeding ground for dangerous bacteria, viruses, and parasites. And the effects of these pathogens are staggering. Diarrheal disease from unsafe water is one of the leading causes of death around the world for children under five. And according to a U.N. report from 2010, microbial water-borne illnesses killed more people per year than war. Proper treatment processes, though, can address these threats. They usually have three parts: sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Once water has been collected in a treatment facility, it's ready for cleaning. The first step, sedimentation, just takes time. The water sits undisturbed, allowing heavier particles to sink to the bottom. Often, though, particles  are just too small to be removed by sedimentation alone and need to be filtered. Gravity pulls the water downward through layers of sand that catch leftover particles  in their pores, prepping the water  for its final treatment, a dose of disinfectant. Chemicals, primarily forms  of chlorine and ozone, are mixed in to kill off any pathogens and to disinfect pipes  and storage systems. Chlorine is highly effective in destroying water's living organisms, but its use remains government-regulated because it has potentially harmful chemical byproducts. And if an imbalance of chlorine occurs during the disinfection process, it can trigger other chemical reactions. For example,  levels of chlorine byproducts, like trihalomethanes, could skyrocket, leading to pipe corrosion and the release of iron, copper, and lead into drinking water. Water contamination from these and other sources including leaching, chemical spills, and runoffs, has been linked  to long-term health effects, like cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and miscarriage. Unfortunately, analyzing the exact risks of chemically contaminated  water is difficult. So while it's clear that disinfectants make us safer by removing disease-causing pathogens, experts have yet  to determine the full scope of how the chemical cocktail  in our drinking water really impacts human health. So how can you tell whether the water you have access to, whether from a tap or otherwise, is drinkable? Firstly, too much turbidity, trace organic compounds, or high-density heavy metals like arsenic, chromium, or lead, mean that the water  is unsuitable for consumption. A lot of contaminants,  like lead or arsenic, won't be obvious without tests, but some clues, like cloudiness, brown or yellow coloration, a foul odor, or an excessive chlorine smell can indicate the need  to investigate further. Water testing kits can go a step further and confirm the presence of many different contaminants and chemicals. With many types of contamination, there are ways of treating water where  it's used instead of close to its source. Point-of-use treatment has actually been around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians boiled away many organic contaminants with the sun's heat. And in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates designed a bag that trapped bad tasting  sediments from water. Today, point-of-use processes usually involve ionization to lower mineral content. They also use adsorption filtration, where a porous material called activated carbon strains the water to remove contaminants and chemical byproducts. While it's not always an effective long-term solution, point-of-use treatment is portable, easy to install, and adaptable. And in regions where large-scale systems are unavailable, or where water has been contaminated further along its journey, these systems can mean the difference between life and death. Clean water remains a precious and often scarce commodity. There are nearly 800 million of us who still don't have regular access to it. The good news is that continued developments in water treatment, both on a large and small scale, can alleviate a lot of unsafe conditions. Implementing proper systems where they're needed and paying careful attention to the ones already in place will fulfill one of the most basic of our human needs."
What is the coldest thing in the world? - Lina Marieth Hoyos,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6aL9YyRx1A,"The coldest materials in the world  aren’t in Antarctica. They’re not at the top of Mount Everest or buried in a glacier. They’re in physics labs: clouds of gases held just fractions of a degree above absolute zero. That’s 395 million times colder  than your refrigerator, 100 million times colder  than liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder than outer space. Temperatures this low give scientists a window into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build  incredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in  the farthest reaches of the universe. How do we create such  extreme temperatures? In short, by slowing down  moving particles. When we’re talking about temperature, what we’re really talking about is motion. The atoms that make up solids, liquids, and gases are moving all the time. When atoms are moving more rapidly, we perceive that matter as hot. When they’re moving more slowly, we perceive it as cold. To make a hot object  or gas cold in everyday life, we place it in a colder environment,  like a refrigerator. Some of the atomic motion in the hot object is transferred to the surroundings, and it cools down. But there’s a limit to this: even outer space is too warm to create ultra-low temperatures. So instead, scientists figured out a way  to slow the atoms down directly – with a laser beam. Under most circumstances, the energy in a laser beam  heats things up. But used in a very precise way, the beam’s momentum can stall  moving atoms, cooling them down. That’s what happens in a device  called a magneto-optical trap. Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber, and a magnetic field  draws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed  at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb a photon of the laser beam and slow down. The slow down effect comes from the transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon. A total of six beams,  in a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling  in all directions will be intercepted. At the center, where the beams intersect, the atoms move sluggishly,  as if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it  described as “optical molasses.” A magneto-optical trap like this can cool atoms down  to just a few microkelvins — about -273 degrees Celsius. This technique was developed in the 1980s, and the scientists  who'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for the discovery. Since then, laser cooling has been  improved to reach even lower temperatures. But why would you want  to cool atoms down that much? First of all, cold atoms can make very good detectors. With so little energy, they’re incredibly sensitive  to fluctuations in the environment. So they’re used in devices that find  underground oil and mineral deposits, and they also make  highly accurate atomic clocks, like the ones used  in global positioning satellites. Secondly, cold atoms hold  enormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. Their extreme sensitivity  makes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves  in future space-based detectors. They’re also useful for the study  of atomic and subatomic phenomena, which requires measuring incredibly  tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms. Those are drowned out  at normal temperatures, when atoms speed around  at hundreds of meters per second. Laser cooling can slow atoms to just  a few centimeters per second— enough for the motion caused by atomic quantum effects to become obvious. Ultracold atoms have already  allowed scientists to study phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation, in which atoms are cooled almost  to absolute zero and become a rare new state of matter. So as researchers continue in their quest  to understand the laws of physics and unravel the mysteries of the universe, they’ll do so with the help  of the very coldest atoms in it."
From the top of the food chain down: Rewilding our world - George Monbiot,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3I9gDocYdk,"We all know about the dinosaurs that once roamed the planet, but long after they went extinct, great beasts we call the megafauna lived on every continent. In the Americas, ground sloths the size of elephants pulled down trees with their claws. Saber-toothed cats the size of brown bears hunted in packs, but they were no match for short-faced bears, which stood thirteen feet on their hind legs, and are likely to have driven these cats away from their prey. There were armadillos as big as small cars, an eight foot beaver, and a bird with a 26 foot wingspan. Almost everywhere, the world's megafauna were driven to extinction, often by human hunters. Some species still survive in parts of Africa and Asia. In other places, you can still see the legacy of these great beasts. Most trees are able to resprout where their trunk is broken to withstand the loss of much of their bark and to survive splitting, twisting and trampling, partly because they evolved to survive attacks by elephants. The American pronghorn can run so fast because it evolved to escape the American cheetah. The surviving animals live in ghost ecosystems adapted to threats from species that no longer exist. Today, it may be possible to resurrect those ghosts, to bring back lost species using genetic material. For instance, there's been research in to cloning woolly mammoths from frozen remains. But even if it's not possible, we can still restore many of the ecosystems the world has lost. How? By making use of abandoned farms. As the market for food is globalized, infertile land becomes uncompetitive. Farmers in barren places can't compete with people growing crops on better land elsewhere. As a result, farming has started to retreat from many regions, and trees have started to return. One estimate claims that two-thirds of land in the US that was once forested but was cleared for farming has become forested again. Another estimate suggests that by 2030, an area in Europe the size of Poland will be vaccated by farmers. So even if we can't use DNA to bring back ground sloths and giant armadillos, we can restore bears, wolves, pumas lynx, moose and bison to the places where they used to live. Some of these animals can reshape their surroundings, creating conditions that allow other species to thrive. When wolves were reintroduced to the Yellowstone National Park in 1995, they quickly transformed the ecosystem. Where they reduced the numbers of overpopulated deer, vegetation began to recover. The height of some trees quintupled in just six years. As forests returned, so did songbirds. Beavers, which eat trees, multiplied in the rivers, and their dams provided homes for otters, muskrats, ducks, frogs and fish. The wolves killed coyotes, allowing rabbits and mice to increase, providing more food for hawks, weasels, foxes and badgers. Bald eagles and ravens fed on the carrion that the wolves abandoned. So did bears, which also ate the berries on the returning shrubs. Bison numbers rose as they browsed the revitalized forests. The wolves changed almost everything. This is an example of a trophic cascade, a change at the top of the food chain that tumbles all the way to the bottom, affecting every level. The discovery of widespread trophic cascades may be one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century. They tell us that ecosystems that have lost just one or two species of large animals can behave in radically different ways from those that retain them. All over the world, new movements are trying to catalyze the restoration of nature in a process called rewilding. This means undoing some of the damage we've caused, reestablishing species which have been driven out, and then stepping back. There is no attempt to create an ideal ecosystem, to produce a heath, a rainforest or a coral reef. Rewilding is about bringing back the species that drive dynamic processes and then letting nature take its course. But it's essential that rewilding must never be used as an excuse to push people off the land. It should happen only with the consent and enthusiasm of the people who work there. Imagine standing on a cliff in England, watching sperm whales attacking shoals of herring as they did within sight of the shore until the 18th century. By creating marine reserves in which no commerical fishing takes place, that can happen again. Imagine a European Serengeti full of the animals that used to live there: hippos, rhinos, elephants, hyenas and lions. What rewilding reintroduces, alongside the missing animals and plants, is that rare species called hope. It tells us that ecological change need not always proceed in the same direction. The silent spring could be followed by a wild summer."
Urbanization and the future of cities - Vance Kite,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKnAJCSGSdk,"Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid-century, this will increase to 70%. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future? In the earliest days of human history, humans were hunter-gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food. But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than search for it, and this led to the development of semi-permanent villages for the first time in history. ""Why only semi-permanent?"" you might ask. Well, at first, the villages still had to relocate every few years as the soil became depleted. It was only with the advent of techniques like irrigation and soil tilling about 5,000 years ago that people could rely on a steady and long-term supply of food, making permanent settlements possible. And with the food surpluses that these techniques produced, it was no longer necessary for everyone to farm. This allowed the development of other specialized trades, and, by extension, cities. With cities now producing surplus food, as well as tools, crafts, and other goods, there was now the possibility of commerce and interaction over longer distances. And as trade flourished, so did technologies that facilitated it, like carts, ships, roads, and ports. Of course, these things required even more labor to build and maintain, so more people were drawn from the countryside to the cities as more jobs and opportunities became available. If you think modern cities are overcrowded, you may be surprised to learn that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities nearly twice as high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta. One reason for this was that transportation was not widely available, so everything had to be within walking distance, including the few sources of clean water that existed then. And the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend against attacks. The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure to overcome these limitations, but other than that, modern cities as we know them, didn't really get their start until the Industrial Revolution, when new technology deployed on a mass scale allowed cities to expand and integrate further, establishing police, fire, and sanitation departments, as well as road networks, and later electricity distribution. So, what is the future of cities? Global population is currently more than 7 billion and is predicted to top out around 10 billion. Most of this growth will occur in the urban areas of the world's poorest countries. So, how will cities need to change to accommodate this growth? First, the world will need to seek ways to provide adequate food, sanitation, and education for all people. Second, growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human population. Food production might move to vertical farms and skyscrapers, rooftop gardens, or vacant lots in city centers, while power will increasingly come from multiple sources of renewable energy. Instead of single-family homes, more residences will be built vertically. We may see buildings that contain everything that people need for their daily life, as well as a smaller, self-sufficient cities focused on local and sustainable production. The future of cities is diverse, malleable, and creative, no longer built around a single industry, but reflecting an increasingly connected and global world."
Why is it so hard to break a bad habit?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr6fQ4KpbRM,"Billions of people deal with a nail-biting habit at some point in their lives. Many will go to great lengths to try to stop, employing strategies like rubbing chili peppers on their cuticles, wearing gloves all day, dipping their hands in salt, and envisioning bacteria crawling on their fingers. And while not all of us are nail-biters, most of us do have a habit we'd like to kick. So what's the best way to break one? Scientists define habits as behaviors that are performed regularly, and cued subconsciously in response to certain environments, whether it be a location, time of day, or even an emotional state. They can include simple actions like picking your hair when stressed, but also more complex practices ingrained in daily routines, like staying up late or brewing your coffee in the morning. If you do something frequently, without much deliberation, then it’s likely a habit. They form because at some point your brain learns that the behavior is beneficial. Let's say after opening a stressful email, you bite your nails. This is rewarding, as it’s enough to focus your attention, curbing your email fueled anxiety. Within your brain, positive experiences can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates feelings of pleasure. Dopamine is also a driver of neuroplasticity, meaning it can change how your neurons wire and fire. Your brain builds connections that link the reward with the behavior, driving you to repeat it. It also starts associating the behavior with other cues, like your environment. Eventually, all it takes is the context of sitting at your desk to subconsciously trigger a nail-biting habit— no stressful email or sense of relief required. Once established, these cue-behavior-reward loops work fast, outpacing the decision-making process. You may find yourself engaging in a habit before you have the chance to notice and stop. But this can be a good thing because not all habits are bad. They’re stored memories of what’s worked in the past, which allow you to take swift action in the present. One study estimated that on average, people spend more than 40% of their days performing regularly repeated behaviors while their minds are occupied with other thoughts. A seemingly automated morning routine, for example, saves you both time and precious mental energy. Still, many people have habits that no longer serve them. Yet research shows that intentions alone often fail to lead to long-term behavior change. This isn’t to say you can’t break a habit. Rather, by understanding the basis of habits, you can create better plans for changing them. For example, we know habits are often cued by environments and routines. Lying in bed may cause you to endlessly scroll through your phone, or watching TV on the couch may lead you to grab a sugary snack. One of the most effective ways to manage behavior is to identify these locations or times of day. Then try to modify them by changing your routine or creating obstacles that make it more difficult to perform the habit in that space. Moving, switching jobs, or even starting a new schedule, are particularly great times to break a habit or build a new one. One 2005 study tracked university students’ exercising, reading, and TV watching habits before and after they transferred schools. When students were no longer around old environments and routines, their habits, even the strong ones, significantly changed. For behaviors like nail-biting  or hair-pulling, a practice called habit reversal training can be helpful. Developed by psychologists in the 1970s, the aim is to change a habit by replacing it with another one that’s less detrimental. The training requires you to analyze and understand your habit cues, so you can effectively intervene at the right times. For example, if you tend to bite your nails at work, preemptively keep a fidget toy at your desk. Then, if a stressful email comes in, use the toy when you feel the urge to bite your nails. Breaking a habit takes time, so remember to give yourself grace and have patience through the process. And while many focus on their bad habits, it’s also worth celebrating the good ones that help us move swiftly and successfully through our daily routines."
Could a Saturn moon harbor life? - Carolyn Porco,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRQdHrGuVgI,two years ago here at Ted I reported that we had discovered at Saturn with the Cassini spacecraft an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnian moon Enceladus seen here this region seen here for the first time in a Cassini image taken in 2005 this is the south polar region with the famous tiger stripe fractures crossing the South Pole and seen just recently in late 2008 here is that region again now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter and I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering Jets erupting from those fractures at the South Pole consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane and at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these Jets might in fact be geysers and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface but we weren't really sure however the implications of those results of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry and perhaps life itself we're so exciting that in the intervening two years we have focused more on Enceladus we've flown the Cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times flying closer and deeper into these Jets into the denser regions of these Jets so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements and we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex and we previously reported while they're not amino acids we're now finding things like propane and benzene hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the Jets come from it's of liquid water but that that liquid water is in contact with rock and that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life so we are very encouraged by these results and we're much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon under the South Pole an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter and that will have to await the arrival back at Enceladus of a spacecraft hopefully sometime in the near future specifically equipped to address that particular question but in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnian system and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park just because we can thank you
The philosophy of cynicism - William D. Desmond,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utzym1I_BiY,"In the 4th century BCE, a banker’s son threw the city of Sinope  into scandal by counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled,  the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship,  his money, and all his possessions. At least, that’s how the story goes. While many of the details  of Diogenes’ life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas  born out of his disgrace survive today. In exile, Diogenes decided  that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success,  he could be truly free. He would live self-sufficiently,  close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity. In practice, this meant he spent years  wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff,  and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing technology,  baths, and cooked food. He didn’t go about this new existence  quietly, but is said to have teased passers-by  and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating  and even masturbating in public. The citizens called him a kyôn—  a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol  for his philosophy— they’re happy creatures, free from abstractions  like wealth or reputation. Diogenes and his growing number  of followers became known as “dog philosophers,”  or kynikoi, a designation  that eventually became the word “Cynic.” These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom  of a wandering lifestyle. As Diogenes’ reputation grew,  others tried to challenge his commitment. Alexander the Great  offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander  to get out of his sunshine. After Diogenes’ death, adherents to his philosophy  continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE. Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone  should follow Diogenes’ example. They also attempted to tone down  his philosophy to be more acceptable  to conventional society— which, of course, was fundamentally at odds  with his approach. Others viewed the Cynics less charitably. In the Roman province of Syria  in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics  of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who only preached  what Diogenes had once actually practiced. Reading Lucian’s texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers  called their rivals cynics as an insult— meaning people who criticized others  without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage eventually laid the groundwork  for the modern meaning of the word “cynic:"" a person who thinks everyone else  is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher motive. Still, the philosophy of cynicism  had admirers, especially among those  who wished to question the state of society. The 18th-century French philosopher  Jean-Jacques Rousseau was called the “new Diogenes” when he argued  that the arts, sciences, and technology, corrupt people. In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche  reimagined a story in which Diogenes  went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain  for a single honest person. In Nietszche’s version, a so-called madman rushes into a town square to proclaim that “God is dead.” This was Nietzsche’s way  of calling for a “revaluation of values,” and rejecting  the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights  beyond the physical world. Nietzsche admired Diogenes  for sticking stubbornly to the here-and-now. More recently, the hippies of the 1960s  have been compared with Diogenes as counter-cultural rebels. Diogenes’ ideas  have been adopted and reimagined  over and over again. The original cynics  might not have approved of these fresh takes: they believed  that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature  were the only true values. Whether or not you agree with that,  or with any of the later incarnations, all have one thing in common:  they questioned the status quo. And that’s an example  we can still follow: not to blindly follow  conventional or majority views, but to think hard  about what is truly valuable."
Can you solve the Ragnarok riddle? - Dan Finkel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrqBX-Tck2A,"Ragnarok. The fabled end of the world, when giants, monsters, and Norse gods  battle for the future. The gods were winning handily until  the great serpent Jörmungandr emerged. It swallowed Valhalla,  contorted itself across the land, and then merged into one continuous body  with no head and no tail. As it begins to digest Valhalla, an exhausted Odin explains that he has  just enough power to strike the creature with one final bolt of lightning. If you magnify his blast  with your fabled hammer, Mjölnir, it should pierce the massive serpent. You’ll run with super-speed  along the serpent’s body. When you hold your hammer high,  Odin will strike it with lightning and split Jörmungandr open at that point. Then, you’ll need to continue  running along its body until every part of it is destroyed. You can’t run over the same section twice or you’ll fall into the already blasted  part of the snake. But you can make multiple passes  through points where the creature intersects its own body. If you leave any portion un-zapped,  Jörmungandr will magically regenerate, Odin’s last power will be spent,  and Valhalla will fall forever. What path can you take to destroy  the serpent? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 2 1 One powerful way to solve problems  is to simplify. And in this case, we can focus  our attention on the two things that are important for our path: intersections and the stretches  of snake between them. Or, as they’re referred  to in graph theory, nodes and edges. The edges are important  because they’re what we need to travel. And the nodes matter  because they connect the edges, and are where we may need to make choices  as we run from edge to edge. This simplification into nodes  and edges leaves us with a ubiquitous and important  mathematical object known as a graph, or network. We just need to figure out how to travel  what mathematicians call an Eulerian path, which traces every edge exactly once. Instead of looking at the path as a whole, let’s zoom in on a single node. During some moment in your run,  you’ll enter that node, and then exit it. That takes care of two edges. If you enter again,  you’ll need to exit again too, which requires another pair of edges. So every point along your path  will have edges that come in pairs. One edge in each pair will function  as entrance; the other as exit. And that means that the number of edges  coming out of every node must be even. There are just two exceptions:  the start and end points, where you can exit  without entering, or vice versa. If we look at the network  formed by the serpent again, and number how many edges  emerge from each node, a pattern jumps out that fits  what we just saw. Every node has an even number  of edges emerging from it, except two. So one of these must be the start  of your route, and the other the end. Interestingly enough, any connected  network that has exactly 2 nodes with an odd number of edges  will also contain an Eulerian path. The same is true if there are no nodes  with an odd number of edges— in that case the path starts  and ends in the same spot. So knowing that,  let’s return to our full graph. We can begin by taking care  of this edge here. Now we can zig-zag back and forth  across the whole snake until we reach the end. And that's just one solution—  it helps to be systematic, but you’re likely to happen  upon many others once you know where to begin  and end your run. You hold your hammer high  at the opportune moment, and Odin sends the world-saving surge  of lightning at you. Then you run  like you’ve never run before. If you can pull this off, surely nothing  could stop the might of the Norse Gods. And if something like that were out there, slouching its way towards you… well, that would be a story  for another day."
3 tips to boost your confidence - TED-Ed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_NYrWqUR40,"Translator: Jennifer Cody Reviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems to lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: ""Be more confident."" And most likely, this is what you think when you hear it: ""If only it were that simple."" But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable, worthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes when you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously  to face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors  that impact confidence. One: what you're born with, such as your genes, which will impact things like the balance of neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures of your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about  and respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle these three factors, but the personal choices we make certainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind  a few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate our own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you an immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success  when you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music with deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose or give yourself a pep talk. Tip two:  believe in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think  about your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed, like a muscle? These beliefs matter because they can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents are locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered  something you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset and think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get stronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset are more successful, getting better grades, and doing better  in the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by twelve different publishers before one picked up ""Harry Potter."" The Wright Brothers built on history's failed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly and keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond  to challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try  different strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge  you want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk,  stand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that whatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge and understanding. This is confidence."
"What causes addiction, and why is it so hard to treat? - Judy Grisel",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBC7i-vHWsU,"As of 2021, more than 36 million people worldwide were estimated to be experiencing substance abuse disorder. This condition spans a spectrum of patterned drug use that causes issues in a person’s life. At the more severe end of the spectrum is substance addiction. To understand why some people are more susceptible to addiction and why it can be so difficult to treat, let’s take a look at how addictive drugs affect the body. When someone repeatedly uses an addictive substance, their brain may adjust to account for its regular presence. This is called tolerance; it diminishes the drug’s effect and means more is required to produce the same experience. Alcohol, for instance, increases the transmission of chemical messengers like endorphin and GABA, which promote sensations of pleasure and calmness. When someone uses alcohol frequently, their brain will adapt to its presence. So when they don’t use it, their brain receives fewer signals from those pleasure- and calm-inducing neurotransmitters, which impacts their energy and mood. In addition to the unique effects each addictive substance has, all of them alter the release of dopamine in a brain region called the nucleus accumbens. This area is part of the brain’s reward pathway, which is sensitive to experiences that give us pleasure and drives us to repeatedly seek them out. The reward pathway is essential to our well-being— but addictive substances also exploit it. When someone is repeatedly using a substance and their body has adapted to its presence, they may develop dependence where the drug is necessary for them to function comfortably. Meanwhile, repeated use can decrease the influence of the brain’s cortex, which is responsible for driving deliberate decision-making and limiting impulsive behaviors. And it can increase the influence of the brain’s subcortex, which is crucial in habit-learning and impulsivity. Together, these changes can make someone feel a lack of control over how they’re using a substance. This can mean suffering in other facets of their life and taking risks to continue using it. If the substance leaves their system, their body's equilibrium is disrupted, so they may experience cravings that motivate thoughts and behaviors of seeking and using the drug. And if they continue without the substance, they may experience withdrawal. Opioids, for example, relieve pain and induce sedation. Withdrawal from them causes heightened pain, anxiety, and insomnia. The faster a drug reaches the brain and stimulates the reward pathway, the more addictive it is. For example, heroin and morphine have similar effects, but heroin’s chemical structure enhances its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and bind to specific receptors. This makes it faster acting and more addictive than morphine. Meanwhile, compared to nicotine patches and gum, regular and electronic cigarettes are more addictive because smoking and vaping deliver nicotine to the brain fastest. Depending on their chemical structure and mode of delivery, drugs vary in how addictive they are— but people also vary in how susceptible they are to substance use disorder. Scientists think this is due to a mix of life experiences and genetically inherited traits, though neither predetermines addiction. Trauma and mental health conditions appear to make people more susceptible. And, overall, using addictive substances before 18 is considered a strong risk factor. This is in part because the reward pathways of younger brains are especially sensitive. Many of the genetic factors at play remain unknown, but some genes do seem to track with certain substance use disorders. For example, specific genes increase the risk for nicotine addiction by making certain receptors more sensitive to nicotine and withdrawal from it more difficult. At the same time, some genes actually make people more resistant to substance use disorders, such as genes that slow the breakdown of alcohol, leading to unpleasant side effects that make people less interested in drinking. In fact, one drug that treats alcohol use disorder operates with this very mechanism. Detoxing from a substance the body has become dependent on can be extremely difficult. And in some cases, abruptly quitting can also be physically risky, so it isn’t always advised. Beyond detoxing, quitting is often a long-term process. It’s aided by treatment plans that prioritize addressing underlying conditions; developing new associations with experiences previously linked with drug use; and creating safe, supportive environments. Ultimately, both addiction and recovery are the results of a brain with an incredible ability to adapt from experience."
Could a breathalyzer detect cancer? - Julian Burschka,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNFscrBEhR0,"How is it that a breathalyzer can measure  the alcohol content in someone’s blood, hours after they had their last drink,  based on their breath alone? Exhaled breath contains trace amounts  of hundreds, even thousands, of volatile organic compounds: small molecules lightweight enough  to travel easily as gases. One of these is ethanol,  which we consume in alcoholic drinks. It travels through the bloodstream  to tiny air sacs in the lungs, passing into exhaled air  at a concentration 2,000 times lower, on average, than in the blood. When someone breathes  into a breathalyzer, the ethanol in their breath  passes into a reaction chamber. There, it’s converted to another molecule, called acetic acid, in a special type of reactor that produces an electric current during the reaction. The strength of the current  indicates the amount of ethanol in the sample of air,  and by extension in the blood. In addition to the volatile  organic compounds like ethanol we consume in food and drink, the biochemical processes of our cells  produce many others. And when something disrupts  those processes, like a disease, the collection of volatile  organic compounds in the breath may change, too. So could we detect disease  by analyzing a person’s breath, without using more invasive  diagnostic tools like biopsies, blood draws, and radiation? In theory, yes, but testing for disease is a lot more  complicated than testing for alcohol. To identify diseases, researchers need to look at a set  of tens of compounds in the breath. A given disease may cause  some of these compounds to increase or decrease in concentration,  while others may not change— the profile is likely to be different  for every disease, and could even vary for different stages  of the same disease. For example, cancers are among  the most researched candidates for diagnosis through breath analysis. One of the biochemical changes  many tumors cause is a large increase  in an energy-generating process called glycolysis. Known as the Warburg Effect, this increase in glycolysis results  in an increase of metabolites like lactate which in turn can affect a whole cascade  of metabolic processes and ultimately result  in altered breath composition, possibly including an increased  concentration of volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. But the Warburg Effect is just one  potential indicator of cancerous activity, and doesn’t reveal anything  about the particular type of cancer. Many more indicators are needed  to make a diagnosis. To find these subtle differences, researchers compare the breath  of healthy people with the breath of people  who suffer from a particular disease using profiles based on hundreds  of breath samples. This complex analysis  requires a fundamentally different, more versatile type of sensor  from the alcohol breathalyzer. There are a few being developed. Some discriminate  between individual compounds by observing how the compounds move  through a set of electric fields. Others use an array of resistors  made of different materials that each change their resistance  when exposed to a certain mix of volatile organic compounds. There are other challenges too. These substances are present  at incredibly low concentrations— typically just parts per billion, much lower than ethanol concentrations  in the breath. Compounds’ levels may be affected  by factors other than disease, including age, gender, nutrition,  and lifestyle. Finally, there’s the issue of distinguishing which compounds  in the sample were produced in the patient’s body and which were inhaled  from the environment shortly before the test. Because of these challenges,  breath analysis isn’t quite ready yet. But preliminary clinical trials  on lung, colon, and other cancers  have had encouraging results. One day, catching cancer early  might be as easy as breathing in and out."
How art gives shape to cultural change - Thelma Golden,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FCihq5n-hE,   the brilliant playright audrianne Kennedy wrote a volume called people who have led my plays and if I were to write a volume it would be called artists who have led my exhibitions because my work in understanding art and in understanding culture has come by following artists by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are JJ from Good Times significant to many people of course because of Dino might but perhaps more significant as the first really black artist on prime time TV Jean Michelle basat important to me because the first black artist in real time that showed me the possibility of who and what I was about to enter into my overall project is about art specifically about black artists very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves my interest is an artists who understand and rewrite history who think about themselves within The Narrative of the larger world of art but who have created new places for us to see and understand I'm showing two artists here Glenn Ligon and Carol Walker two of many who really form for me the essential questions that I wanted to bring as a curator to the world I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create create a new story a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world and to do this I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work understand the artist studio as a laboratory imagine then Reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper asking questions providing the space to look and to think about answers in 1994 when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum I made an exhibition called blackmail it looked at the intersection of race and gender in Contemporary American art it sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for a dialogue complicated dialogue dialogue with many many points of entry and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas this exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view what was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator as a catalyst for this dialogue one of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding of themselves and each other I'm showing you two works one on the right by Leon golb one on the left by Robert kscott and in the course of the exhibition which was contentious controversial and ultimately for me life-changing in my sense of what art could be a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other and she pointed to the work on the Left To Tell me how problematic this image was as it related for her to the idea of how black people had been represented and she pointed to the image on the right as an example to me of the kind of dignity that needed to be portrayed to work against those images in the media she then assigned these Works racial identities basically saying to me that the work on the right clearly was made by a black artists the work on the left clearly by a white artist went in effect that was the opposite case Bob kott African-American artist Leon golb uh a a white artist the point of that for me was to say in that space in that moment that I really more than anything wanted to understand how images could work how images did work and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images fast forward and I end up in Harlem home for many of Black America very much the psychic heart of the black experience really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed Harlem now s of explaining and thinking of itself in this part of the century looking both backwards and forwards I always say Harlem is an interesting Community because unlike many other places it thinks of itself in the past present and the future simultaneously no one speaks of it just in the now it's always what it was and what it can be and in thinking about that then my second project the second question I ask is can a museum be a catalyst in a community can a museum house artists and allow them to be change agents as communities rethink themselves this is Harlem actually on January 20th thinking about itself in a very wonderful way so I work now at the studio Museum in Harlem thinking about exhibitions there thinking about what it means to discover Arts possibility now what does this mean to some of you in some cases I know that many of you are involved in cross-cultural dialogues you're involved in ideas of creativity and Innovation think about the place that artists can play in that that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that I work towards in working with young black artists think about artists not as content providers though they can be brilliant at that but again as real Catalyst the studio Museum was founded in the late 60s and I bring this up because it's important to locate this practice in history to look at 1968 in the incredible historic moment that is and think of the arc that has happened since then to think of the possibilities that we are all privileged to stand in today and imagine that this Museum that came out of a moment of great protest and one that was so much about examining the history and the leg Legacy of important African-American artists to the history of Art in this country like Jacob Lawrence Norman Lewis ramir Bearden and then of course to bring us to today in 1975 Muhammad Ali gave a lecture at Harvard University after his lecture this A student got up and said to him give us a poem and Muhammad Ali said me we a profound statement about the individual and the community the space in which now in my project of discovery of thinking about artists of trying to Define what might be black art cultural movement of the 21st century what that might mean for cultural movements all over in this moment the miwe seems incredibly precient totally important to this end the specific project that has made this possible for me is a series of exhibitions all titled with an F freestyle frequency and flow which have set out to discover and Define the young black artist working in this moment who I feel strongly will continue to work over the next many years this series of exhibitions was made specifically to try and question the idea of what it would mean now at this point in history to see art as a catalyst what it means now at this point in history as we Define and redefine culture Black Culture specifically in my case but culture generally I named this group of artists around an idea which I put out there called post black really meant to Define them as artists who came and start their work now looking back at history but star in this moment historically it is really in this sense of discovery that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking this new set of questions is what does it mean right now to be africanamerican in America what can artwork say about this where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation really most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring their works for me are about not always just simply about the aesthetic Innovation that their minds imagine that they Visions create and put out there in the world but more perhaps importantly through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation as well as in the future I am continually Amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be I am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work it is why I Look to Art it's why I ask questions of art it is why I make exhibitions now this exhibition as I said 40 Young Artists done over a course of eight years and for me it's about considering the implications it's considering the implications of this generation has to say to the rest of us it's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as work travels but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us it's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it and imagining particularly in urban America about the nurturing of this Spirit now where perhaps does this end up right now for me it is about reimagining this cultural discourse in an international context so the last iteration of this project has been call flow with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world really looking not so much from Harlem and out but looking across and Flo looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa and as many of us think about that continent and think about what it means to us all in the 21st century I have begun that looking through artists through artworks and imagining what they can tell us about the future with they tell us about our future and what they create in their sense of offering us this great possibility of watching that continent emerge as part of our bigger dialogue so what do I discover when I look at artworks what do I think about when I think about art I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works the discovery of exciting works but really it has been what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition to talk about beauty to talk about power to talk about ourselves and to talk and speak to each other that's what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world thank   you
What makes the Great Wall of China so extraordinary - Megan Campisi and Pen-Pen Chen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23oHqNEqRyo,"A 13,000 mile dragon of earth and stone winds its way through the countryside of China with a history almost as long and serpentine as the structure. The Great Wall began as multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual feudal states during the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders north of China and each other. When Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified the states in 221 BCE, the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean became natural barriers, but the mountains in the north remained vulnerable to Mongol, Turkish, and Xiongnu invasions. To defend against them, the Emperor expanded the small walls built by his predecessors, connecting some and fortifying others. As the structures grew from Lintao in the west to Liaodong in the east, they collectively became known as The Long Wall. To accomplish this task, the Emperor enlisted soldiers and commoners, not always voluntarily. Of the hundreds of thousands of builders recorded during the Qin Dynasty, many were forcibly conscripted peasants and others were criminals serving out sentences. Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang to the Bohai Sea. Forced labor continued under the Han Emperor Han-Wudi , and the walls reputation grew into a notorious place of suffering. Poems and legends of the time told of laborers buried in nearby mass graves, or even within the wall itself. And while no human remains have been found inside, grave pits do indicate that many workers died from accidents, hunger and exhaustion. The wall was formidable but not invincible. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion of the 13th Century. After the Ming dynasty gained control in 1368, they began to refortify and further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones from local kilns. Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide, the walls 5500 miles were punctuated by watchtowers. When raiders were sighted, fire and smoke signals traveled between towers until reinforcements arrived. Small openings along the wall let archers fire on invaders, while larger ones were used to drop stones and more. But even this new and improved wall was not enough. In 1644, northern Manchu clans overthrew the Ming to establish the Qing dynasty, incorporating Mongolia as well, Thus, for the second time, China was ruled by the very people the wall had tried to keep out. With the empire's borders now extending beyond the Great Wall, the fortifications lost their purpose. And without regular reinforcement, the wall fell into disrepair, rammed earth eroded, while brick and stone were plundered for building materials. But its job wasn't finished. During World War II, China used sections for defense against Japanese invasion, and some parts are still rumored to be used for military training. But the Wall's main purpose today is cultural. As one of the largest man-made structures on Earth, it was granted UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1987. Originally built to keep people out of China, the Great Wall now welcomes millions of visitors each year. In fact, the influx of tourists has caused the wall to deteriorate, leading the Chinese government to launch preservation initiatives. It's also often acclaimed as the only man-made structure visible from space. Unfortunately, that's not at all true. In low Earth orbit, all sorts of structures, like bridges, highways and airports are visible, and the Great Wall is only barely discernible. From the moon, it doesn't stand a chance. But regardless, it's the Earth we should be studying it from because new sections are still discovered every few years, branching off from the main body and expanding this remarkable monument to human achievement."
How can technology transform the human body? - Lucy McRae,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlO23t8cKZM,I call myself a body architect I trained in classical ballet and have a background in architecture and fashion as a body architect I fascinate with the human body and explore how I can transform it I worked at Philips Electronics in the far future design research lab looking 20 years into the future I explored the human skin and how technology can transform the body I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo which is augmented by touch or dresses that blushed and shivered with light I started my own experiments these were the low-tech approaches to other high-tech conversations I was having these are q-tip stuck to my roommate with wig glue I started a collaboration with a friend of mine bot Hess he doesn't normally look like this and we used ourselves as models we transformed our apartments into our laboratories and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way we were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution whilst I was at Philips we discussed this idea of a maybe technology something that wasn't either switched on or off but in between and maybe that could take the form of like a gas or a liquid and I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body so you couldn't see where the skin ended in the near environment started I set up my studio in the red-light district and obsessively wrap myself in plumbing tubing and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile I was introduced to robin the swedish pop star and she was also exploring how technology coexist with raw human emotion and she talked about how technology with these new feathers this new face paint this Punk the way that we identify with the world and we made this music video I'm fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology in the future away from disease and aging and I thought about this concept of imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor modify a biologically enhancer and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other or the way that we attract sexual partners and would we revert back to being more like animals more primal modes of communication I worked with a synthetic biologist and I created a swallowable perfume which is a cosmetic pill that you eat and the fragrance comes out through the skin surface when you perspire it completely blows apart the way that perfume is and provides a whole new format it's perfume coming from the inside out it redefines the role of skin and our bodies become an atomizer I've learned that there's no boundaries and if I look at the evolution of my work I can see threads and connections that make sense but when I look towards the future the next project it's completely unknown and wide open I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me and it's these conversations and these experiences that connect these ideas and they kind of instinctively come out as a body Architects I've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever I want and I feel like I've just got started so here's to another day at the office
The power of the placebo effect - Emma Bryce,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z03FQGlGgo0,"In 1996, 56 volunteers took part in a study to test a new painkiller called Trivaricaine. On each subject, one index finger was covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched. Then, both were squeezed in painful clamps. The subjects reported that the treated finger hurt less than the untreated one. This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually a painkiller, just a fake concotion  with no pain-easing properties at all. What made the students so sure this dummy drug had worked? The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies that aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better. Doctors have used the term placebo since the 1700s when they realized the power of fake drugs to improve people's symptoms. These were administered when proper drugs weren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill. In fact, the word placebo means ""I shall please"" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating troubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments in order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that duping people in this way had another use: in clinical trials. By the 1950s, researchers were using placebos as a standard tool to test new treatments. To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive the real pill. The other half would get a placebo that looked the same. Since patients wouldn't know whether they'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. Then, if the new drug showed a significant benefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective. Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos this way because of ethical concerns. If it's possible to compare a new drug against an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving someone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment. In these cases, placebos are often used as a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus the old or alternative drug can be precisely compared. But of course, we know the placebos exert their own influence, too. Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief  from a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received was a fake drug or sham surgery. We're still trying to understand how. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused with other factors, like patients trying to please doctors by falsely reporting improvements. On the other hand, researchers think that if a person  believes a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually do trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms. Placebos seem to be capable of causing measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing chemicals, like endorphins. That explains why subjects in pain studies often say placebos ease their discomfort. Placebos may even reduce levels of stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects of an ailment. So shouldn't we celebrate the placebo's bizarre benefits? Not necessarily. If somebody believes a fake treatment has cured them, they may miss out on drugs or therapies that are proven to work. Plus, the positive effects  may fade over time, and often do. Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even  more motivated to discover how they wield such power over us. Despite everything we know about the human body, there are still some strange and enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect. So what other undiscovered marvels might we contain? It's easy to investigate the world around us and forget that one of its most  fascinating subjects lies right behind our eyes."
You can only save one— who do you choose? - Doug MacKay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1x7FqXRy9c,"You are the captain of the Mallory 7, an interstellar cargo transport. On your way to the New Lindley spaceport, you receive a distress call. There’s been an explosion on the Telic 12 and its passengers are running out of oxygen. As you set a course to intercept,  you check the Telic 12′s manifest. It’s currently transporting  30 middle-aged individuals from some of Earth’s poorest districts  to the labor center on New Lindley, where they'll be assigned jobs on the spaceport. But as you approach the Telic 12,  you receive a second distress call. A luxury space cruiser called  the Pareto has lost a thruster, sending them careening  towards an asteroid belt. Without your help, the 20 college students headed for vacation aboard the Pareto are all doomed. So with only enough time to save one ship, which one should you choose? This dilemma is an example of a broader class of problems where a life-saving resource—  such as a donated organ or vaccine— is scarce. There are many schools of thought  on how to approach these problems, and one of the most influential is utilitarianism, an ethical view first systematically developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. In this view, you should choose the action which promises the greatest sum of happiness. Though, how to define and measure  happiness is a difficult question. For example, hedonists would suggest  a happy life contains the most pleasure  and the least pain. Others might say it’s the life  where your desires are most fulfilled. However happiness is defined, most would agree that saving 30 lives  has the potential to generate more happiness than saving 20. But is it enough to consider  how many lives would be saved? Or should you also consider how many life years would be? Assuming a life expectancy of 80,  saving the lives of the students, with an average age of 20,  saves 1,200 life years, while saving the workers,  with an average age of 45, saves 1,050. All things being equal,  a longer life should promise a greater sum of happiness than a shorter one. So perhaps saving the smaller ship actually has the potential to generate the most happiness. If all these calculations feel a bit cold, you may want to consider a different approach. The philosopher Derek Parfit argues  we should give priority to the worse off, since benefits to those groups  matter more than equivalent benefits to the well-off. In this view, it’s more urgent to help those whose basic needs aren’t met even if they’re harder to help  than those who are flourishing. But often, determining which group is  truly worse off can get complicated fast. In our case, Earth is still beset  by drastic inequalities in wealth and opportunity. And those able to afford a vacation on New Lindley and transport on a luxury cruiser are no doubt among the most well-off  people on the planet. The workers, by contrast,  are among the most disadvantaged, traveling away from home for months at a time to perform service work. With fewer resources and opportunities, it’s likely they’ve experienced more hardship in their lives than the vacationers, so maybe they’re more deserving of rescue? On the other hand, the students have experienced less life overall— so perhaps they’re worse off? Or maybe none of these variables should influence our decision. The philosopher John Taurek famously  argued that in these types of cases, the numbers don’t count. Each person is deserving  of equal concern and respect, so the best way to decide which passengers to save is to flip a coin. While this might seem arbitrary at first, this approach treats all parties equally, giving each individual  an equal chance of being rescued. Could any passenger argue that they're being treated unfairly by a coin flip? It’s tough to say. But how they— and you— feel about the  result may be another dilemma altogether."
Can you solve the demon dance party riddle? - Edwin Meyer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT-d8MlT27A,"Once each year, thousands of logicians descend into the desert for Learning Man, a week-long event they attend to share their ideas, think through tough problems... and mostly to party. And at the center of that gathering  is the world’s most exclusive club, where under the full moon,  the annual logician’s rave takes place. The entry is guarded  by the Demon of Reason, and the only way to get in is to solve one of his dastardly challenges. You’re attending with 23  of your closest logician friends, but you got lost on the way  to the rave and arrived late. They're already inside, so you must face down the demon alone. He poses you the following question: When your friends arrived, the demon put masks on their faces and forbade them from communicating in any way. No one at any point could see their own masks, but they stood in a circle where they could see everyone else’s. The demon told the logicians that he  distributed the masks in such a way that each person would eventually be able  to figure out their mask’s color using logic alone. Then, once every two minutes, he rang a bell. At that point, anyone who could come to him and tell him the color of their mask  would be admitted. Here’s what happened: Four logicians got in at the first bell. Some number of logicians, all in red  masks, got in at the second bell. Nobody got in when the third bell rang. Logicians wearing at least two different colors got in at the fourth bell. All 23 of your friends played  the game perfectly logically and eventually got inside. Your challenge, the demon explains, is to tell him how many people gained entry when the fifth bell rang. Can you get into the rave? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s initially difficult to imagine  how anyone could, using just logic and the colors they see on the other masks, deduce their own mask color. But even before the first bell, everyone will realize something critical. Let’s imagine a single logician with a silver mask. When she looks around, she’d see  multiple colors, but no silver. So she couldn’t ever know that silver  is an option, making it impossible for her to logically  deduce that she must be silver. That contradicts rule five, so there must be at least two masks of each color. Now, let’s think about what happens when there are exactly two people wearing  the same color mask. Each of them sees only one mask  of that color. But because they already know  that it can’t be the only one, they immediately know that their own mask  is the other. This must be what happened before the first bell: two pairs of logicians each realized their own mask colors when they saw a unique color in the room. What happens if there are three people  wearing the same color? Each of them—A, B and C— sees two people with that color. From A’s perspective, B and C would be expected to behave the same way that the orange and purple pairs did,  leaving at the first bell. When that doesn’t happen, each of the three realizes that they are  the third person with that color, and all three leave at the next bell. That was what the people  with red masks did— so there must have been three of them. We’ve now established a basis  for inductive reasoning. Induction is where we can solve  the simplest case, then find a pattern that will allow  the same reasoning to apply  to successively larger sets. The pattern here is that everyone  will know what group they’re in as soon as the previously sized group has the opportunity to leave. After the second bell,  there were 16 people. No one left on the third bell, so everyone then knew there weren’t  any groups of four. Multiple groups, which must have been of five, left on the fourth bell. Three groups would leave a solitary mask wearer, which isn’t possible,  so it must’ve been two groups. And that leaves six logicians outside  when the fifth bell rings: the answer to the demon’s riddle. Nothing left to do but join your friends  and dance."
A brief history of toilets - Francis de los Reyes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dYk99S98Jc,"On sunny days,  the Roman citizens of Ostia could be found on a long stone bench near the Forum. Friends and neighbors exchanged  news and gossip while simultaneously attending to more... urgent business. These public latrines could sit up to 20 Romans at a time, draining waste in water conduits below. Today, most cultures consider trips to the restroom to be a more private occasion. But even when going alone, our shared sewage infrastructure is one of the most pivotal inventions  in the history of humanity. While many ancient religious texts  contain instructions for keeping waste away from drinking water and campsites, waste management took a more familiar shape as early as 3000 BCE. Ancient Mesopotamian settlements often had clay structures made for squatting or sitting  in the most private room of the house. These were connected to pipes which used running water to move waste into street canals and cesspits. Water infrastructure like this flourished  in the Bronze Age, and in some parts of the Indus Valley, nearly every house had a toilet connected to a citywide sewage system. Ancient Cretan palaces even offered a manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain  what inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management is essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground for dangerous microorganisms, including those that cause cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. It would be several millennia before scientists fully understood the relationship between sewage and sickness. But the noxious odors of sewage have recorded associations with disease as early as 100 BCE. And by 100 AD, more complex  sanitation solutions were emerging. The Roman Empire had continuously  flowing aqueducts dedicated to carrying waste  outside city walls. Chinese dynasties of the same period  also had private and public toilets, except their waste  was immediately recycled. Most household toilets fed into pig sties, and specialized excrement collectors gathered waste from public latrines to sell as fertilizer. In China, this tradition of waste  management continued for centuries, but in Europe the fall of the Roman Empire brought public sanitation  into the Dark Ages. Pit latrines called “gongs”  became commonplace, and chamber pots were frequently dumped into the street. Castles ejected waste from tall windows into communal cesspits. At night, so-called gong farmers  would load up the waste before traveling beyond city limits  to dump their cargo. Europe's unsanitary approach persisted for centuries, but toilets themselves underwent some major changes. By the late Middle Ages,  most wealthy families had commode stools— wooden boxes with seats and lids. And in the royal court of England, the commodes were controlled by the Groom of the Stool. In addition to monitoring  the king’s intestinal health, the Groom’s... intimate relationship  with the monarch made him a surprisingly influential figure. The next major leap in toilet technology came in 1596, when Sir John Harrington designed  the first modern flush toilet for Queen Elizabeth. Its use of levers to release water  and a valve to drain the bowl still inform modern designs. But Harrington’s invention  stank of sewage. Thankfully, in 1775,  Scottish inventor Alexander Cumming added a bend in the drainpipe  to retain water and limit odors. This so-called S-trap was later improved into the modern U-bend by Thomas Crapper— though the term “crap” predates  the inventor by several centuries. By the turn of the 19th century, many cities had developed  modern sewage infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants, and today, toilets have a wide range of features, from the luxurious to the sustainable. But roughly 2 billion people still don’t  have their own toilets at home. And another 2.2 billion  don’t have facilities that properly manage their waste, putting these communities  at risk of numerous diseases. To solve this problem, we’ll need  to invent new sanitation technologies and address the behavioral, financial,  and political issues that produce inequity  throughout the sanitation pipeline."
Why was India split into two countries? - Haimanti Roy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrcCTgwbsjc,"In August 1947, India gained independence after 200 years of British rule. What followed was one of the largest and bloodiest forced migrations in history. An estimated one million people  lost their lives. Before British colonization, the Indian subcontinent was a patchwork  of regional kingdoms known as princely states populated  by Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, and Jews. Each princely state had  its own traditions, caste backgrounds, and leadership. Starting in the 1500s, a series  of European powers colonized India with coastal trading settlements. By the mid-18th century,  the English East India Company emerged as the primary colonial power  in India. The British ruled some provinces directly, and ruled the princely states indirectly. Under indirect rule, the princely states remained sovereign but made political and financial  concessions to the British. In the 19th century, the British began to  categorize Indians by religious identity— a gross simplification  of the communities in India. They counted Hindus as “majorities” and all other religious communities  as distinct “minorities,” with Muslims being the largest minority. Sikhs were considered part of the Hindu community by everyone but themselves. In elections, people could only vote  for candidates of their own religious identification. These practices exaggerated differences, sowing distrust between communities that had previously co-existed. The 20th century began with decades  of anti-colonial movements, where Indians fought for independence from Britain. In the aftermath of World War II, under enormous financial strain  from the war, Britain finally caved. Indian political leaders had  differing views on what an independent India  should look like. Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru represented the Hindu majority and wanted one united India. Muhammad Ali Jinnah,  who led the Muslim minority, thought the rifts created by colonization were too deep to repair. Jinnah argued for a two nation division where Muslims would have a homeland  called Pakistan. Following riots in 1946 and 1947, the British expedited their retreat, planning Indian independence behind closed doors. In June 1947, the British viceroy announced that India would gain independence by August, and be partitioned into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan— but gave little explanation of how exactly this would happen. Using outdated maps, inaccurate census numbers and minimal knowledge of the land, in a mere five weeks, the Boundary Committee drew a border dividing three provinces  under direct British rule: Bengal, Punjab, and Assam. The border took into account where  Hindus and Muslims were majorities, but also factors like location and population percentages. So if a Hindu majority area bordered another Hindu majority area, it would be included in India— but if a Hindu majority area bordered Muslim majority areas, it might become part of Pakistan. Princely states on the border had to choose which of the new nations to join, losing their sovereignty in the process. While the Boundary Committee worked  on the new map, Hindus and Muslims began moving to areas where they thought they’d be a part  of the religious majority— but they couldn’t be sure. Families divided themselves. Fearing sexual violence, parents sent  young daughters and wives to regions they perceived to be safe. The new map wasn’t revealed  until August 17th, 1947— two days after independence. The provinces of Punjab and Bengal became the geographically separated  East and West Pakistan. The rest became Hindu-majority India. In a period of two years, millions  of Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan left for India, while Muslims living in India  fled villages where their families had lived for centuries. The cities of Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta,  Dhaka, and Karachi emptied of old residents  and filled with refugees. In the power vacuum British forces left behind, radicalized militias and local groups  massacred migrants. Much of the violence occurred in Punjab, and women bore the brunt of it, suffering rape and mutilation. Around 100,000 women were kidnapped  and forced to marry their captors. The problems created by Partition went far beyond this immediate deadly aftermath. Many families who made temporary moves  became permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded and became the new country of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Hindu ruler of Kashmir decided to join India— a decision that was to be finalized by a public referendum of the majority Muslim population. That referendum still hasn't happened as of 2020, and India and Pakistan have been warring over Kashmir since 1947. More than 70 years later, the legacies of the Partition remain  clear in the subcontinent: in its new political formations and  in the memories of divided families."
What do all languages have in common? - Cameron Morin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQW3zC5QaY4,"Language is endlessly variable. Each of us can come up with  an infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start  to communicate in sentences. How is this possible? In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky  proposed a theory based on the observation that the key  to this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure  of an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning. He suggested that there are  grammatical rules that apply to all languages, and that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process language according to these rules. He labelled this faculty  universal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry  that shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field  of cognitive science for decades to come. Chomsky and other researchers  set out to investigate the two main components  of universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact,  grammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules  are hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish  the universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool known as generative syntax, which represents the order of words  in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible. Based on this tree, we could suggest  a grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases. But with more data,  it quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear  outside of verb phrases. This simplified example illustrates  a major problem: it takes a lot of data  from each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages  might have in common. When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume  of recorded samples necessary to analyze them  using generative syntax. Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language is incredibly complex. After 50 years of analysis, we still haven’t completely figured out English. As more linguist data  was gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages  around the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were  universal grammar rules. In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate  this variation. According to his new hypothesis  of principles and parameters, all languages shared certain  grammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters,  or the application of these principles. For example, a principle is  “every sentence must have a subject,"" but the parameter of whether the subject must be explicitly stated could vary between languages. The hypothesis of principles  and parameters still didn’t answer the question of which grammatical principles are universal. In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested  that there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures can be nested inside each other. Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence  within a sentence. Or this sentence, which embeds  a noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase. Recursion was a good candidate  for a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms. However, in 2005 linguists  published findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have  any recursive structures. So what about the other part  of Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate? When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically  determined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. It challenged the dominant paradigm,  called behaviorism. Behaviorists argued that all animal  and human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside  by the mind, which starts out as a blank slate. Today, scientists agree that behaviorism  was wrong, and there is underlying,  genetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. Many think the same biology  responsible for language is also responsible for other  aspects of cognition. So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated, innate language faculty in the brain. The theory of universal grammar prompted the documentation and study of many languages  that hadn’t been studied before. It also caused an old idea to be  reevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing  understanding of the human brain."
Sex needs a new metaphor. Here's one ... - Al Vernacchio,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeqPCWrw-t4,  i'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education by comparison if you talk to someone today in america about sexual activity you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity you're also talking about baseball because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity and we know that because there's all this language in english that seems to be talking about baseball but that's really talking about sexual activity so for example you could be a pitcher or a catcher and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act of course they're the bases which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order ultimately resulting in a scoring a run or hitting a home run which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm at least for the guy you can strike out which means you don't get to have any sexual activity and if you're a benchwarmer you might be a virgin or somebody for whom whatever reason isn't in the game maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skill set a bat's a penis and a nappy dugout is a vulva or a vagina a glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom a switch hitter is a bisexual person and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team and then there's this one if there's grass on the fields play ball and that usually refers to if a young person specifically often a young woman is old enough to have pubic hair she's old enough to have sex with this baseball model is incredibly problematic it's sexist it's heterosexist it's competitive it's goal directed and it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults so we need a new model i'm here today to offer you that new model and it's based on pizza now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience so let's do this let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity the trigger for sexual activity what happens during sexual activity and the expected outcome of sexual activity so when do you play baseball you play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule it's not exactly your choice so if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren't home hey it's just batter up can you imagine saying to your coach uh not really feeling it today i think i'll sit this game out that's just not the way it happens and when you get together to play baseball immediately you're with two opposing teams one playing offense one playing defense somebody's trying to move deeper into the field that's usually assigned to the boy somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field that's often given to the girl it's competitive we're not playing with each other we're playing against each other and when you show up to play baseball nobody needs to talk about what we're gonna do or how this baseball game might be good for us everybody knows the rules you just take your position and play the game but when do you have pizza well you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza it starts with an internal sense an internal desire or a need huh i could go for some pizza and because it's an internal desire we actually have some sense of control over that i can decide that i'm hungry but know that it's not a great time to eat and then when we get together with someone for pizza we're not competing with them we're looking for an experience that both of us will share that that's satisfying for both of us and when you get together for pizza with somebody what's the first thing you do you talk about it you talk about what you want you talk about what you like you may even negotiate how do you feel about pepperoni not so much i'm kind of a mushroom guy myself well maybe we can go half and half and even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time don't you still say things like should we get the usual or maybe something a little more adventurous okay so when you're playing baseball so if you talk about during sexual activity when you're playing baseball you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time you can't hit the ball and run to right field that doesn't work and you also can't get to second base and say i like it here i'm going to stay here no and also of course with baseball there's like the specific equipment and a specific skill set not everybody can play baseball it's pretty exclusive okay but what about pizza when we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza isn't it all about what's our pleasure there are a million different kinds of pizza there's a million different toppings there's a million different ways to eat pizza and none of them are wrong they're different and in this case difference is good because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience and lastly what's the expected outcome of baseball well in baseball you play to win you score as many runs as you can there's always a winner in baseball and that means there's always a loser in baseball but what about pizza well in pizza we're not really there's no winning how do you win pizza you don't but you do look for are we satisfied and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or in different days and we get to decide when we feel satisfied if we're still hungry we might have some more if you eat too much though you just feel gross so what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education a lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model and it sets up education that can't help but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people and those young people become older people but if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires to make deliberate decisions about what they want to talk about it with their partners and to ultimately look for not some external outcome but for what feels satisfying and we get to decide that you may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison under the baseball it's all commands they're all exclamation points but under the pizza model they're questions and who gets to answer those questions you do i do so remember when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity baseball you're out pizza is the way to think about healthy satisfying sexual activity and good comprehensive sexuality education thank you very much for your time 
Why plague doctors wore beaked masks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMt8xm4t7XQ,"The year is 1656. Your body is wracked  by violent chills. Your head pounds, your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck  and armpits. In your feverish state, you see  a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask, his body covered from head to toe. He examines you  and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most  terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro- Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th, and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases—  about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films  about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood  with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent  combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper, turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed 2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air known as miasma. People believed this bad air spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included  an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma  from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that, in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea  transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis,  from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s outfit may have provided some unintentional protection  from flea bites. However, not enough information survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was  no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors—  costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety  of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes  concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison  or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim  of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes  in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally, that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully— cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means to quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies like test kits, masks to deter the spread  of respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make sure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage and compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help and comfort those who need it most."
An athlete uses physics to shatter world records - Asaf Bar-Yosef,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaGUW1d0w8g,"In the early 1960s, Dick Fosbury tried his hand at almost every sport, but never excelled at anything, until, at the age of 16, he turned to the high jump. But when he couldn't compete against the strong athletes at his college using the standard high jump techniques of the time, Fosbury tried to jump a different way: backwards. Instead of jumping with his face towards the bar, bringing each leg over in the traditional straddle method, he jumped with his back towards the bar. Fosbury improved his record by over half a foot, and left his coaches amazed by this strange new style of high jumping. During the next few years, Fosbury perfected his high jump style, won the U.S. National trials, and assured his place in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico. In the Olympic Games, Fosbury amazed the world with his new technique, winning a gold metal with an Olympic record leap of 2.24 meters. By the next Olympic Games, almost all of the competing of high jumpers had adopted what came to be known as the Fosbury Flop. What's the secret behind the technique? It lies in a physics concept called the center of mass. For every object, we can locate the average position of all of its mass by taking into account how the mass is spread around the object. For instance, the center of mass of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density will be in the intersection of both diagonals, in equal distance from each corner. We can find the center of mass for other objects by similar calculations, or by finding the object's balancing point, which lies right underneath its center of mass. Try balancing a broom by holding it and slowly bringing your hands together until they meet. This balancing point lies right underneath the broom's center of mass. We humans also have a center of mass. When most people stand up, their center of mass is around the belly, but what happens to your center of mass when you lift your hands in the air? Your center of mass moves upwards. It moves all the time as you move through the day, based on how your body is positioned. It can even move outside of your body. When you bend forward, your center of mass is located below your bent belly in a place where there is no mass at all. Weird to think about, but that's the average position of all your mass. Many objects' center of mass are outside their bodies. Think of doughnuts or boomerangs. Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position of the center of mass of the jumper. The jumper runs very fast, so he can divert his horizontal velocity to vertical velocity, and jumps. Wait for it...there. Look at the jumper's center of mass as his body bends backward. It's below the bar. That is the secret behind the jump. With the old, pre-Fosbury techniques, the jumper had to apply enough force to lift his center of mass above the bar by a few inches in order to clear it. The Fosbury Flopper doesn't have to do that. The genius of the Fosbury Flop is that the jumper can apply the same amount of force, but raise his body much higher than before. That means he can raise the bar so high that even when his center of mass can't go any higher, his arching body can. Fosbury's technique brought the high jump to new heights by splitting the jumper's body away from his center of mass, giving it that much more room to clear higher and higher bars. So the Fosbury Flop may be sports history's only great leap forward, that is also a great leap backward."
How movies teach manhood - Colin Stokes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ywYXbGKstQ,  you know my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids and when my daughter was four we got to watch The Wizard of Oz together totally dominated Her Imagination for months her favorite character was Glinda of course gave a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand but you know you watch a movie enough times and you start to realize how unusual it is now we live today and are raising our children in a kind of Children's Fantasy spectacular industrial complex but the Wizard of Oz stood alone it did not start that Trend 40 years later was when the trend really caught on with interestingly another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a Girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards do you know what I'm talking about yeah now there's a big difference between these two movies a couple of really big differences between the Wizard of Oz and all the movies we watch today one is there's very little violence in The Wizard of Oz the uh monkeys are rather aggressive as are the apple trees but but um I think if the Wizard of Oz were made today the wizard would say Dorothy you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold use your magic slippers to defeat the computer generated armies of the wicked witch um that's not how it happens another thing that's really unique about The Wizard of Oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female now uh I started to notice this when I actually showed Star Wars to my daughter uh which was years later and and the situation was different at that point I also had a son uh he was only three at the time he was not invited to this screening he is too young for that uh but he was a second child and the level of supervision had plummeted so uh he wandered in and it imprinted on him like uh mommy duck does to its duckling and uh I don't think he understand what's what's going on but uh he is sure soaking in it and I wonder what he's soaking in is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the Universe except for aunt baru and of course this princess who's really cool but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe which he does uh by the magic that he was born with compare this to 1939 with the Wizard of Oz how does Dorothy win her movie by making friends with everybody and being a leader like that's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in Oz right and not the world of dudes fighting which is where we kind of have to be why is there so much force capital F force in the movies we have for our kids and so little yellow brick road I mean there is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy violent movie has on girls and you should do that reading it's very good I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world uh that is co-ed um I think uh you know there was a kind of first kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie right I finished my quest I got the girl why are you still standing there uh I don't know what I'm supposed to do the movies are very very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other Journeys it's almost as though if you're a boy you are a Dopey animal and if you were a girl you should bring your warrior costume I mean there are plenty of exceptions and I I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any of you um but they do uh send a message to boys that they're not the boys are not really the target audience I mean they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy but they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy there's no models for them and we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are these are still war movies and of course the most successful Studio of all time uh continues to crank out classic after Classic every single one of them about the Journey of a boy or a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son or uh two men who are raising a little girl um until as many of you are thinking this year when they finally came out with brave I recommend it to all of you it's on demand now um do you remember what the critic said when Brave came out oh I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie It's very good don't let that stop you now almost none of these movies pass the beal test I don't know if you've heard of this has not yet caught on and caught fire but maybe today we will start a movement Allison Beckle is a comic book artist and back in the mid 80s she uh recorded this um conversation she'd had with a friend uh about assessing the movies that they saw and it's very simple there's just three questions you should ask uh is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines she try to meet that bar and uh do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like right thank you thank you very much two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff it it does happen I've seen it and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love in fact this week I went to see uh a very high quality movie Argo right Oscar buzz doing great at the box office a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is pretty much flunks the beal test and I don't think it should because there a lot of the movie I don't know if you've seen it but a lot of the movie uh takes place in this Embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis we got quite a few scenes of the men having deep angst-ridden conversations in this Hideout and the the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say are you coming to bed honey like that's Hollywood for you so let's let's look at the numbers 2011 of the 100 most popular movies how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists 11 it's not bad it's not as it's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to congress so that's good um but there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down in uh last year in the New York Times published a study that the government had done here's what it said one out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life now I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment I don't think kids movies have anything to do with that I don't even think that you know music videos or pornography are really Direct irly related to that but something is going wrong and when I hear that statistic one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual as salant who are these guys what are they learning what are they failing to learn are they absorbing the story that a male Hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak are we soaking up that story you know as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them we have tools at our disposal like girl power and we hope that that will help but I got to wonder is girl power going to protect them if at the same time actively or passively we are training our sons to maintain their boy Power I mean I think the Netflix cue is one way that we can do something very important and I'm talking mainly to the dads here I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood now the definition of manhood is already uh turning upside down I mean you've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner they're throwing it up in the air so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this some new relationship with each other and I think we really have to show them and model for them how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them and wants to be on their team and stands up against the real bad guys who are the men who want to abuse the women and I think our job in the Netflix cue is to look out for those movies that pass the beal test if we can find them and to seek out the heroins who are there who show real courage who bring people together and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroins and to say I want to be on their team because they're going to be on their team when I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in Star Wars do you know what she said Obi-Wan Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glenda now what do these two have in common maybe it's not just the sparkly dress I think these people are experts I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them Reach their potential now they're leaders I like that kind of quest for my daughter and I like that kind of quest for my son I want more quests like that I want fewer quests where my son is told go out and fight it alone and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team maybe a team led by women to help other people become better and be better people like The Wizard of Oz thank  you
How do self-driving cars “see”? - Sajan Saini,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRg5RNU_JLk,"It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving  car winds down a narrow country road. Suddenly, three hazards appear  at the same time. What happens next? Before it can navigate this  onslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about  their size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms  can plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors  that’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment,  weather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. That’s a tall order, but there’s a  solution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe  called LIDAR, and a miniature version of  the communications technology that keeps the internet humming, called integrated photonics. To understand LIDAR, it helps to start  with a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses  of radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing  how long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size  can’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s  LIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection  and Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the  button on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape,  or depth, of these features? LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser  pulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse  scatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip  of one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer  the second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system quickly renders a detailed profile. The most obvious way to create a pulse  of light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and  affects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically  block the light reliably and rapidly. That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed  pulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is  with a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a  particular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap,  a pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add  up to become very large; in other places, they completely  cancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator  does something similar. It splits waves of light along two  parallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and  delayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and  cancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch,  emitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred  picoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a  few centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need  to see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super- sensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined  to a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with  20/20 vision, from across a street. The first generation of automobile LIDAR  has relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk  to less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one  day fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever  variation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts  and scan at rapid speeds. By slowing the light in a modulator  arm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more  like a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with  a tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel  can be designed: a steerable laser beam. From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and  see more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number  of obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose."
How CRISPR lets you edit DNA - Andrea M. Henle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tw_JVz_IEc,"From the smallest single-celled organism to the largest creatures on earth, every living thing is defined  by its genes. The DNA contained in our genes acts like an instruction manual for our cells. Four building blocks called bases are  strung together in precise sequences, which tell the cell how to behave and form the basis for our every trait. But with recent advancements  in gene editing tools, scientists can change an organism’s fundamental features in record time. They can engineer drought-resistant crops and create apples that don’t brown. They might even prevent the spread  of infectious outbreaks and develop cures for genetic diseases. CRISPR is the fastest, easiest, and  cheapest of the gene editing tools responsible for this new wave of science. But where did this medical  marvel come from? How does it work? And what can it do? Surprisingly, CRISPR is actually a  natural process that’s long functioned as a  bacterial immune system. Originally found defending single-celled  bacteria and archaea against invading viruses, naturally occurring CRISPR uses  two main components. The first are short snippets of  repetitive DNA sequences called “clustered regularly interspaced  short palindromic repeats,” or simply, CRISPRs. The second are Cas, or “CRISPR-associated” proteins which chop up DNA like molecular scissors. When a virus invades a bacterium, Cas proteins cut out a segment  of the viral DNA to stitch into the bacterium’s  CRISPR region, capturing a chemical snapshot  of the infection. Those viral codes are then copied  into short pieces of RNA. This molecule plays many roles  in our cells, but in the case of CRISPR, RNA binds to a special protein  called Cas9. The resulting complexes act like scouts, latching onto free-floating  genetic material and searching for a match to the virus. If the virus invades again, the scout complex recognizes it immediately, and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA. Lots of bacteria have this type  of defense mechanism. But in 2012, scientists figured out  how to hijack CRISPR to target not just viral DNA, but any DNA in almost any organism. With the right tools, this viral immune system becomes a  precise gene-editing tool, which can alter DNA and  change specific genes almost as easily as fixing a typo. Here’s how it works in the lab: scientists design a “guide” RNA  to match the gene they want to edit, and attach it to Cas9. Like the viral RNA in the  CRISPR immune system, the guide RNA directs Cas9  to the target gene, and the protein’s molecular scissors  snip the DNA. This is the key to CRISPR’s power: just by injecting Cas9 bound to a short  piece of custom guide RNA scientists can edit practically  any gene in the genome. Once the DNA is cut, the cell will try to repair it. Typically, proteins called nucleases trim the broken ends and  join them back together. But this type of repair process, called nonhomologous end joining, is prone to mistakes and can lead to extra or missing bases. The resulting gene is often unusable  and turned off. However, if scientists add a separate  sequence of template DNA to their CRISPR cocktail, cellular proteins can perform  a different DNA repair process, called homology directed repair. This template DNA is used as a blueprint  to guide the rebuilding process, repairing a defective gene or even inserting a completely new one. The ability to fix DNA errors means that CRISPR could potentially  create new treatments for diseases linked to specific genetic errors, like  cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. And since it’s not limited to humans, the applications are almost endless. CRISPR could create plants  that yield larger fruit, mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria, or even reprogram drug-resistant  cancer cells. It’s also a powerful tool  for studying the genome, allowing scientists to watch  what happens when genes are turned off or changed within an organism. CRISPR isn’t perfect yet. It doesn’t always make  just the intended changes, and since it’s difficult to predict the  long-term implications of a CRISPR edit, this technology raises  big ethical questions. It’s up to us to decide the  best course forward as CRISPR leaves single-celled  organisms behind and heads into labs, farms, hospitals, and organisms around the world."
Listening to shame - Brené Brown,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jtZdSRst94,"  I'm going tell you a little bit about my tedex Houston talk I woke up the morning after I gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life and I actually didn't leave my house for about 3 days the first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch and when I walked in she was already at the table and I sat down and she said God you look like hell I said thanks um I feel really I I'm I'm not functioning and she said what's going on and I said I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data as absolutely essential to wholehearted living I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown I had a slide that said breakdown it what point did I think that was a good idea and she said I saw your talk live streamed it was it was not really you um it was a little different than what you usually do but it was great and I said this can't happen YouTube they're putting this thing on YouTube and we're going to be talking about 600 700 people and she said well I think you know it's too late and I said let me ask you something and she said yeah and I said do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb she said yeah and I said remember when we leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape and she goes uh no so of course the only thing I could think of to say at that point was yeah me neither I that that that yeah I yeah me neither and I'm thinking to myself brne what are you doing what are you doing why did you bring this up have you lost your mind your sisters with be perfect for this so I looked back up and she said are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube and I said I'm just thinking about it a little bit she said you're like the worst vulnerability role model ever and then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic I said if 500 turns into a thousand or 2,000 my life is over I had no contingency plan for 4 million um and my life did end when that happened and maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself and that was that as much as I would be frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small staying right under the radar but I want to talk about what I've learned there's two things that I've learned in the last year um the first is vulnerability is not weakness and that myth is profoundly dangerous let me ask you honestly and I'll give you this this warning I'm trained as a therapist so I can outweight you uncomfortably um so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome um how many of you honestly when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable think God vulnerability is weakness this is weakness how many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously the majority of people now let me ask you this question this past week at Ted how many of you when you saw vulnerability up here thought it was pure courage vulnerability is not weakness I Define vulnerability as emotional risk exposure uncertainty it fuels our daily lives and I have come to the belief this is my 12th year doing this research that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest one of the weird things that's happened is after the Ted explosion um I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country um everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies um and so many of the calls went like this hey Dr Brown we your Ted Talk we'd like you to come in and speak we'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame what would you like for me to talk about there's three big answers this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector Innovation creativity and change so let me go on the record and say vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation creativity and  change to create is to make something that has never existed before there's nothing more vulnerable than that adaptability to change is all about vulnerability the second thing in addition to really find L understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage the second thing I learned is this we have to talk about shame and I'm going to be really honest with you when I became like a vulnerability researcher um and that became the focus because of the Tad talk and I'm not kidding that I'll give you an example about three months ago I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shinguards and all the things that parents buy at this sping goods store about from a 100 feet away this is what I hear vulnerability Ted vulnerability Ted yeah I'm a fifth generation Texan our family motto is Lock and Load I am not a natural vulnerability researcher um so I'm like just keep walking she's on my six um and then I hear vulnerability t i turn around I go hi she's right here and she said you're the shame researcher who had the breakdown at this point parents are like pulling their children close look away um and I'm so worn out at this point in my life I look at her and I actually say it was a freaking Spiritual Awakening and she looks back and does this I know and she said we watched your Ted Talk in my book club then we read your book and we renamed ourselves the breakdown babes and she said our tagline is we're falling apart and it feels f fantastic you can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting so when I became vulnerability Ted like an action figure like ninja Barbie but I'm vulnerability Ted um I thought I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability and I thought thank God because shame is this horrible topic no one wants to talk about it it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane what do you do I study shame oh um and I see you you know uh but in surviving this last year I was reminded of a cardinal rule not a research rule but a moral imperative from my up in you got to dance with the one who BR you and I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and Innovation from studying vulnerability I learned about these things from studying shame and so I want to walk you in to shame Union analysts call shame the swamping of the soul and we're going to walk in and the purpose is not to walk walk in and you know construct a home and live there it is to put on some gashes and walk through and find our way around here's why we heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country and I think globally around race right yes we heard that yes cannot have that conversation without shame because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege and when people start talking about privilege they get paralyzed by shame we heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery which is have a checklist you can't fix that problem without addressing shame because when they teach those folks how to suture they also teach them how to stitch their selfworth to being all powerful and all powerful folks don't need checklist and I had to write down the name of this Ted fellow so I didn't mess it up here Michigan ingal I hope I did right by you I saw the Ted fellas my first day here and he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily and he said I saw this need so you know what I did I made it and everybody just burn into Applause and they were like yes and he said and it didn't work and then I made it 32 more times and then it worked you know what the big secret about Ted is I can't wait to tell people this I I guess I'm doing it right now um this is like the failure conference no it is you know why this place is amazing because very few people here are afraid to fail and no one that gets on the stage so far that I've seen has not failed I have failed miserably many times I don't think the world understands that because of Shame there's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt um a lot of people refer it to it as the man in the arena quote and it goes like this it is not the critic who counts it is not the man who sits and points out how the of Deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles the credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat but when he's in the arena at best he wins and at worst he loses but when he fails when he loses he does so daring greatly and that's what this conference to me is about that's what life is about about daring greatly about being in the arena when you walk up to that Arena and you put your hand on the door and you think I'm going in and I'm going to try this shame is the grimlin who says uh-uh you're not good enough you never finished that NBA your wife left you I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg he was in sing Singh I know you those things that happened to you growing up I know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough I know your dad never paid attention even when you made CFO shame is that thing and then if we can quiet it down and walk in and say I'm G to do this we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing 99% of the time is who us shame drives two big tapes never good enough and if you can talk it out of that one who Do You Think You Are the thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on Behavior shame is I am bad guilt is I did something bad how many of you if you did something that was hurtful to me would be willing to say I'm sorry I made a mistake how many of you would be willing to say that guilt I'm sorry I made a mistake shame I'm sorry I am a mistake there is a huge difference between shame and guilt and here's what you need to know shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders and here's what you even need to know more guilt inversely correlated with those things the ability to hold something we've done our fail to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive it's uncomfortable but it's adaptive the other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender if shame washes over me and washes over Chris it's going to feel the same everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of Shame we're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy which means yes I have a little shame no I'm a sociopath so I would opt for yes you have a little shame shame feels the same for men and women but it's organized by gender for women the best example I can give you is anali Le the commercial I can put the wash on the line pack the lunches hand out the kisses and be work at 5: to 9: I can bring home the bacon fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man for women shame is do it all do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold but I guarantee you it moved a lot of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds shame for women is this web of unattainable conflicting competing expectations about who we're supposed to be and it's a straight jacket for men shame is not about bunch of competing conflicting expectations shame is one do not be perceived as what weak I did not interview men for the first four years of my study and it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing and said I love what you have to say about shame I'm curious why you didn't mention men and I said I don't study men and he said that's convenient and I said why and he said because you say to reach out tell our story be vulnerable but you see those books you just sign for my wife and my three daughters I said yeah they'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down when we reach out and be vulnerable we get the beat out of us and don't tell me it's from are the guys and the coaches and the dads because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else so I started interviewing men and asking questions and what I learned is this you show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work you show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it she can't do it all anymore and his first response is not I unloaded the dishwasher but he really listens cuz that's all we need I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work shame is an epidemic in our culture and to get out from underneath it to find our way back to each other we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way our parenting the way we're working the way we're looking at each other very quickly some research by mahalik at Boston College he asked what do women need to do to conform to female Norms the top answers in this country nice thin modest and use all available resources for appearance when he asked about men what do men in this country need to do to conform with male Norms the answers were always show emotional control work is first pursue status and violence if we're going to find our way back to each other we have to understand and know empathy because empathy is the antidote to shame if you put shame in a Petri dish it needs three things to grow exponentially secrecy silence and judgment if you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and doubts it with empathy it can't survive the two most powerful words when we're in struggle me too and so I'll leave you with this thought if we're going to find our way back to to each other vulnerability is going to be that path and I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena because I think I did it my whole life and think to myself I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect and that is seductive but the truth is that never happens and even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there that's not what we want to see we want you to go in we want to be with you and across from you and we just want for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with to dare greatly so thank you'all very much I really appreciate it w"
Making a TED-Ed Lesson: Visualizing big ideas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P50NcJLSJJY,"Do you ever struggle to find the perfect description when trying to convey an idea? Like a foggy picture, adjectives and modifiers fail to depict what's in your mind. Illustrators often face a similar challenge, especially when attempting to explain complex and difficult concepts. Sometimes the imagery is intangible or way too complicated to explain with a picture. Although complex information could be relayed using charts and stats, this could get pretty boring. Instead, just like when writing an essay to describe, for example, emotions, illustrators can use visual metaphors to bring to life difficult concepts. Just as a written metaphor is a description that relates one object to another, a visual metaphor uses imagery to suggest a particular association or point of similarity. Our lesson ""Big Data"" is a great example of a situation where visual metaphors played a huge role in explaining the concept. What is Big Data in the first place? Good question! Big Data is a huge amount of digital information produced worldwide on a daily basis, challenging us to find solutions for storing, analyzing, and also imagining it visually. Quite an elusive concept! How should we depict this? Let's take a look at our ""Big Data"" script. We start with smaller computer servers that branch out into bigger networks to produce data, then even bigger networks and production of even more data. You see where we're going with this -- an object growing and branching out in many directions and producing something as a result? Does that remind you of something? Just like those computer networks, a tree grows and branches out to produce more leaves each year. And every year, just as the data accumulates and faces us with a challenge to find storage solutions, it gets harder to collect those piles of leaves when they fall off the tree. Aha! There's our visual metaphor! Okay, so we have the script, audio, and a visual metaphor. The next step in visual development is to design the characters and environments of the animation. To do so, we think of an appropriate and appealing style to illustrate the ideas and help the viewer better understand what they're hearing. Let's go back to the script and see if we can find any clues there. Our story starts in the 1960s when the first computer networks were built. This decade will serve as a good point to make the stylistic choice for our animation as it will allow us to refer to artwork from that era. You may want to start by looking at some art books (design, illustrations, cartoons, etc.) from that era and find a style that may our own purpose. Look closely, study the material, and try to understand the choices artists of that time made and why. For example, the 1960s minimalist animation style was a significant departure from the cinematic realism that was popular in animated films at the time. The choice to use limited animation techniques was originally made for budgetary reasons, but it became a signature style that influenced many future generations of animators. In this stylistic approach, the simplified characters, flat backgrounds, and angular shapes come together to create new interpretations of reality, which also sounds like a good place to begin visualizing our own Big Data. Well, let's try an experiment. ""In the 1980s islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but tortuous."" Is this better? ""In the 1980s islands of similar networks speaking different dialects sprung up all over Europe and the States, making remote access possible but tortuous. To make it easy for our physicists across the world to access the ever-expanding Big Data stored at CERN without traveling, the networks needed to be talking with the same language."" As you probably observed, graphic representations are a great way to capture the interest of your audience. By depicting what you want to present and explain with strong, memorable visuals, you can communicate your idea more effectively. So, now, challenge yourself. Think of an abstract concept that cannot be explained with simple words. Go ahead and try your hand at visually developing that idea."
Why are some people left-handed? - Daniel M. Abrams,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGLYcYCm2FM,"If you know an older left-handed person, chances are they had to learn to write or eat with their right hand. And in many parts of the world, it's still common practice to force children to use their ""proper"" hand. Even the word for right also means correct or good, not just in English, but many other languages, too. But if being left-handed is so wrong, then why does it happen in the first place? Today, about 1/10 of the world's population are left-handed. Archeological evidence shows that it's been that way for as long as 500,000 years, with about 10% of human remains showing the associated differences in arm length and bone density, and some ancient tools and artifacts showing evidence of left-hand use. And despite what many may think, handedness is not a choice. It can be predicted even before birth based on the fetus' position in the womb. So, if handedness is inborn, does that mean it's genetic? Well, yes and no. Identical twins, who have the same genes, can have different dominant hands. In fact, this happens as often as it does with any other sibling pair. But the chances of being right or left-handed are determined by the handedness of your parents in surprisingly consistent ratios. If your father was left-handed but your mother was right-handed, you have a 17% chance of being born left-handed, while two righties will have a left-handed child only 10% of the time. Handedness seems to be determined by a roll of the dice, but the odds are set by your genes. All of this implies there's a reason that evolution has produced this small proportion of lefties, and maintained it over the course of millennia. And while there have been several theories attempting to explain why handedness exists in the first place, or why most people are right-handed, a recent mathematical model suggests that the actual ratio reflects a balance between competitive and cooperative pressures on human evolution. The benefits of being left-handed are clearest in activities involving an opponent, like combat or competitive sports. For example, about 50% of top hitters in baseball have been left-handed. Why? Think of it as a surprise advantage. Because lefties are a minority to begin with, both right-handed and left-handed competitors will spend most of their time encountering and practicing against righties. So when the two face each other, the left-hander will be better prepared against this right-handed opponent, while the righty will be thrown off. This fighting hypothesis, where an imbalance in the population results in an advantage for left-handed fighters or athletes, is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection. But according to the principles of evolution, groups that have a relative advantage tend to grow until that advantage disappears. If people were only fighting and competing throughout human evolution, natural selection would lead to more lefties being the ones that made it until there were so many of them, that it was no longer a rare asset. So in a purely competitive world, 50% of the population would be left-handed. But human evolution has been shaped by cooperation, as well as competition. And cooperative pressure pushes handedness distribution in the opposite direction. In golf, where performance doesn't depend on the opponent, only 4% of top players are left-handed, an example of the wider phenomenon of tool sharing. Just as young potential golfers can more easily find a set of right-handed clubs, many of the important instruments that have shaped society were designed for the right-handed majority. Because lefties are worse at using these tools, and suffer from higher accident rates, they would be less successful in a purely cooperative world, eventually disappearing from the population. So by correctly predicting the distribution of left-handed people in the general population, as well as matching data from various sports, the model indicates that the persistence of lefties as a small but stable minority reflects an equilibrium that comes from competitive and cooperative effects playing out simultaneously over time. And the most intriguing thing is what the numbers can tell us about various populations. From the skewed distribution of pawedness in cooperative animals, to the slightly larger percentage of lefties in competitive hunter-gatherer societies, we may even find that the answers to some puzzles of early human evolution are already in our hands."
Music and creativity in Ancient Greece - Tim Hansen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aAunaw1GA,"We live in a society obsessed with music. We use music to worship, tell stories, to celebrate, to work, exercise, declare our love and sometimes our hatred, and, arguably most importantly, to dance. And, of course, we play music ourselves because, well, it's a pleasant thing to do. Thousands of years ago  in Ancient Greece, when it came to music, things weren't much different. They might have had lyres and tunics instead of MP3 players and jeans, but the Ancient Greeks  were just as obsessed with music as we are today. In fact, music was such  an important part of Ancient Greek society that it makes us seem  tame by comparison. To really understand just  how integral music was to the Ancient Greeks, let's begin by acquainting ourselves with a bit of their mythology. In Ancient Greek mythology, it was believed that human creativity was the result of divine inspiration from a group of goddesses  known as the Muses. While scholars have argued  over the years that there are anything  between 3 and 13 Muses, the standard number accepted today is 9. Each Muse oversees her own specific area of artistic expertise, ranging from song and dance to history and astronomy. It might seem strange to categorize history and astronomy  as creative pursuits, but the Ancient Greeks  saw these disciplines as more than just school subjects. These were the hallmarks of civilization in what, to their eyes, was a pretty barbaric world. An educated, civilized person was expected to be proficient in all aspects of creative thought inspired by the Muses, and the common medium through which these  disciplines were taught, studied, and disseminated was music. You see, it's no coincidence that the word Muse is very similar to the word music. It's where the word originates. Poetry, be it a love poem or an epic poem about  a dragon-slaying hero, was sung with a musical accompaniment. Dancing and singing, obviously, were accompanied by music. Theater was always a combination of spoken word and music. History was recounted through song. Even the study of astronomy was linked to the same physical principles as musical harmony, such as the belief held  by many Greek thinkers that each of the planets and stars created their own unique sound as they traveled through the cosmos, thrumming like  an enormous guitar string light-years long. However, music pervaded  more aspects of their lives than just education. Ancient Greeks considered music to be the basis for understanding the fundamental interconnectedness of all things in the universe. This concept of connectivity is known as harmonia, and it's where we get the word harmony. Music was used as a form of medicine to treat illnesses and physical complaints, as a vital accompaniment  to sporting contests, and as a means to keep workers in time as they toiled away on  monotonous or menial tasks. One of the most important applications of music in Ancient Greek society is found in the belief that music can affect a person's ethos. A word we still use today, ethos is a person's guiding beliefs or personal ethics, the way that one behaves towards oneself and others. The Greek philosopher Plato, one of the most famous and influential Greek  thinkers of the time, asserted that music had a direct effect on a person's ethos. Certain kinds of music could incite a person to violence while others could placate a person into a benign, unthinking stupor. According to Plato, only very specific types of music were beneficial to a person's ethos. One should only listen to music that promotes intelligence, self-discipline, and courage, and all other kinds  of music must be avoided. Furthermore, Plato fervently denounced any music that deviated from established musical conventions, fearing that doing so would lead to the degradation of the standards of civilization, the corruption of youth, and eventually complete  and utter anarchy. While Plato's fears can seem extreme, this argument has appeared  in modern times to condemn musical trends such as jazz or punk or rap. What do you think Plato would say about the music you listen to? Is it beneficial to your ethos, or will it degenerate you into a gibbering, amoral barbarian?"
Finding life we can't imagine - Christoph Adami,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p89ZirjNPMQ,so I have a strange career I know it because people come up to me like colleagues and say Chris give a strange career and I can see that point because you know I started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist and I was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions and I was only 14 years old no no no no I wasn't 14 years old but after that I actually had my own lab in a computational neuroscience department and I wasn't doing any neuroscience later I would work on evolutionary genetics and work on systems biology but I'm gonna tell you about something else today I'm gonna tell you about how I learned something about life and I was actually a rocket scientist I was a rocket something I wasn't really a rocket scientist but I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in sunny California where it's warm whereas now I'm in the Midwest and it's cold but it was an exciting experience one day a NASA manager comes into my office sits down and says can you please tell us how do we look for life outside earth and that came as a surprise to me because I was actually hired to work on quantum computation yet I had a very good answer I said I have no idea and he told me bio signatures we need to look for a bio signature and I said what is that and he said it's any measurable phenomenon that allows us to indicate the presence of life and I said really because it's not easy I mean way of life can't you apply like a definition like for example a Supreme Court like a definition of life and then thought about it a little bit and I said well is it really that easy because yes if you see something like this then all right fine I'm gonna call it a life no doubt about it but here's something it goes like right that's life - I know that extent if you think that life is also defined by things that die you're not in luck with this thing because that's actually very strange organism it grows up into its adult stage like that and then goes through like a Benjamin Button phase initially goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again and then actually grows back up and back down and back up sort of yo-yo and it never dies so it's actually life but it's actually not as we thought life would be and then you see something like that and it was like my god what kind of a life-form is that anyone know it's actually not life it's a crystal so once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things so this particular person wrote a whole article and said hey these are bacteria except if you look a little bit closer you see in fact that this thing is way too small to be anything like that so he was convinced but in fact most people aren't and then of course NASA also had a big announcement in fact President Clinton gave a press conference about this amazing discovery of life in a Martian meteorite except that nowadays it's heavily disputed if you take the lessons of all these pictures then you realize well actually maybe it's not that easy maybe I do need a definition of life in order to make that kind of distinction so can life be defined well how would you do about it well of course you go to breathe you know Encyclopedia Britannica and open that L know of course you don't do that you put it somewhere in Google and then you might get something and what you might get and you go there anything that actually refers to you know things that we are used to you throw away and then you can might come up with something like this and it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts who on earth would write something as convoluted and complex and inane it's actually you know a really really important set of concepts so I'm highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to but in fact on processes only and if you take a look at that this was actually in a book that I wrote that this was artificial life and that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with because the idea was that with concepts like that maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life and so if you go and ask yourself what on earth is artificial life let me give you like a whirlwind to of how all this stuff came about and it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses and for those of you who aren't old enough you have no idea how this infection was working namely through these floppy disks but the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that if you look at the rate at which these infection work they show like the spiky behavior that you're used to like from flu virus and it is in fact due to this arms race between hackers and operating system designers that things go back and forth and the results is kind of a tree of life of these viruses a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we're used to at least on the viral level so is that life not as far as I'm concerned why because these things don't evolve by themselves in fact they have hackers writing them but the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the Santa Fe Institute decided why don't we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve and this was stay in rasmussen and he designed the system but it didn't really work because these viruses were constantly destroying each other but there was another scientist they had been watching this an ecologist and he went home and said I know how to fix this and he wrote the chera system and in my book is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems except for the fact that these programs didn't really grow in complexity so having seen this work worked a little bit on us this is where I came in and I decided to create a system that has all the properties that are necessary to see in fact the evolution of complexity more and more complex programs constantly evolving and of course since I really don't know how to write code I'll help him decide two undergraduate students at California Institute of Technology that worked with me that's Charles or free on the left titus brown on the right they are now actually respectable professors at Michigan State University but I can assure you back in the days you know we were not a respectable team and I'm really happy that no photo survives of the three of us anywhere close together but what is the system like well I can't really go into the details but what you see here is some of the entrails but what I want you to focus on is this type of population structures about ten thousand programs sitting here and all different strains are colored in different colors and as you see here there are groups that are growing on top of each other because they're spreading anytime there's a program that's better that's surviving in this world due to whatever mutation that is acquired it's going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction so I'm going to show you a movie where you're gonna see that kind of dynamics and this movie star I mean these kind of experiments are started with programs that we you wrote ourselves we write our own self replicator are now very proud of ourselves and we put them in and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation by the way this is highly accelerated so it's like a thousand generations a second but the system goes like what kind of a dumb piece of code was this this can be approved upon in so many ways so quickly so you see waves of new types taking over the other types and this type of activity goes on for quite a while until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs and then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially ways for a new type of innovation like this one which is going to spread over all the innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved and this process goes on and on and on so what we see here is a system that lives in very much the way that we're used to life goes but what the NASA people had asked me really was do these guys have a bio signature can we measure this type of life because if we can may we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids so I said well perhaps we should construct a bio signature based on life as a universal process in fact it should perhaps make use of the concepts that I developed just in order to sort of capture what this simple living system might be and the thing I came up with I have to first give you sort of a introduction about the idea and maybe that would be a meaning detector rather than a life detector and the way we would do that it's like okay I would like to find out how I can distinguish text that was written by a million monkeys as opposed to texts that are in our books I don't like to do it in such a way that I don't actually have to be able to read the language because you know I'm sure I won't be able to as long as I know that there's some sort of alphabet so here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equally frequent but if you now look at the same distribution in English text it looks like that and I'm telling you this is very robust across English text and if I look at French text it looks a little bit different or Italian or German they all have their own type of frequency distribution but it's robust it doesn't matter what it writes about politics or about science it doesn't matter whether it's a a poem or whether it is in a mathematical text it's a robust signature and it's very stable as long as our books are written in English because people are rewriting them and recopying them it's going to be there so that inspired me to think about well what if I try to use this idea in order not to detect random text from text with meaning but rather detect the fact that there is meaning in the biomolecules that make up life but first I have to ask what are these building blocks like the alphabet elements that I showed you well that we have many different alternatives for such a set of building blocks we could use amino acids we could use nucleic acid covered silica acid fatty acids and for chemistry is extremely rich and our body uses a lot of them so that we actually to test this idea first take took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids and here's the result here is in fact what you get if you for example look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or in fact in a laboratory where you made very sure that in your primordial soup that there is no living stuff in there what you find is the mostly lysine and then alanine and that's a trace element of the other ones okay that is also very robust what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids but there is no life but suppose you take a you know some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers because there's bacteria all over the place or you take water anywhere on earth because it's teeming with life and you make the same analysis this spectrum looks completely different of course there's still glycine and alanine but in fact there are these heavy elements this heavy amino acids that are being produced because they are valuable to the organism and some other ones that are not used in the set of twenty there will not appear at all at any type of concentrations so this also turns out to be extremely robust it doesn't matter what kind of sediment you're using to grind up with its bacteria or any other you know plants or animals anywhere there's a life you're going to have this distribution as opposed to that distribution and it is detectable not just in the amino acids now you could ask well what about these variants they're variants being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity so this is the distribution that you get if in fact there is no life they have about twenty eight of these instructions and if you have a system where they're being replaced one by the other it's like the monkeys riding on a typewriter each of these instructions appears was roughly the equal frequency but if you now take us take a set of replicating guys like in the video that you saw it looks like this so are there some instructions that are extremely valuable to these organisms and their frequency is going to be high and there's actually some instructions that Yuri only want to use once if ever so they write either poisonous or really you know should be used at less of a level than random and in this case the frequency is lower and so now we can see is that really a robust signature I can tell you indeed it is because this type of spectrum just like what you've seen in box and just like what you've seen in many ways it's it doesn't really matter how you change the environment it's very robust it's going to reflect the environment so I'm going to show you now a little experiment that we did and I have to explain to you the top of this graph shows you that frequency distribution that I talked about okay here in fact that's the lifeless environment where each instruction occurs at an equal frequency and below there I show in fact the mutation rate in the environment and I'm starting this Anna mutation rate that is so high that even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire world if you drop it in it gets mutated less immediately okay so there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate but then I slowly turn down the heat so to speak and then there is this viability threshold where now it would be possible for a replicator to actually live and indeed we're going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time so let's see how what that looks like so first nothing nothing nothing too hot too hot now the viability threshold is reached and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and in fact stabilized so now I what I did there is I just I was being nasty I just turned up the heat again again and of course it reaches the viability threshold and I'm just showing this to again because it's so nice you hit the viability threshold the distribution changes to alive then once you hit the threshold where the mutation rate is so high that you cannot sell for produce you cannot copy the information forward to your offspring without making so many mistakes that your ability to replicate vanishes and then that signature is lost what do we learn from that well I think we learn a number of things from that one of them is if we are able to think about life in abstract terms and we're not talking about things like plants and we are talking about amino acids and we're not talking about bacteria but we think in terms of processes then we can start to think about life not as something that is so special to earth but that in fact could exist anywhere because it really only has to do with these concepts of information of storing information within physical substrates anything bits nucleic acids anything that's an alphabet and make sure that there's some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect the time scales for the deterioration you know of information and if you couldn't do that then you have life so the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone without referring at all to the type of things that you know we hold dear as far as the type of life on Earth is and that in a sense removes us again like all of our scientific discoveries or many of them it leads to a continuous death rolling of man of like how I think we're special because we are live well we can make life we can make life in the computer granted it's limited but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it and once we have that then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say if we understand the fundamental processes that do not refer to any particular substrate then we can go out and try other worlds figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be figure enough about the normal chemistry the geochemistry of the planet so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life and then look like two large deviations from this this thing sticking out which says this chemical really shouldn't be there now we don't know that there is life then but we could say well at least I'm gonna have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see well you know where it comes from and that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it and so that's really the only take-home message that I have for you life can be less mysterious that we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets and if we remove the mystery of life then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are and I'm gonna leave you with that and thank you very much
Experiments that hint of longer lives - Cynthia Kenyon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdrY3Z7c-Ps,"have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer and put off aging this is a dream of the ages but scientists have for a long time thought this was just never going to be possible they thought you know you just wear out something you can do about it kind of like an old shoe but if you look at nature you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans now these animals are different from one another because they have different genes so that suggests that somewhere in this gene somewhere in the DNA our genes for aging genes that allow them to have different lifespans so if there are genes like that then you can imagine that if you could change one of the genes in an experiment an aging gene maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan and if you could do that then you could find the genes for aging and if they exist and you can find them then maybe one could eventually do something about it so we set out to look for genes that control aging and we didn't study any of these animals instead we studied a little tiny roundworm called C elegans which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence and we were really optimistic that we could find something because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant so we started to change jeans at random looking for long-lived animals and we were very lucky to find that mutations that damaged one single gene called daph to double the lifespan of the little worm so you can see in black after a month they're very short-lived that's why we like to study them for studies of Aging in black after a month the normal worms are all dead but at that time most of the mutant worms are still alive and it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead and now I want to show you what they actually look like in this movie here so the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about a college student age a young adult it's quite a cute little fellow next you're going to see the long live mutant when its young so this animal is going to live twice as long is it miserable it doesn't seem to be it's very active you can't tell the difference really and they can be completely fertile have the same number of progeny the normal worms do now get out your handkerchiefs here you're going to see in just two weeks the normal worms are old you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there but everything else is just lying there the animals clearly in the nursing home and if you look at the tissues of the animal they're starting to deteriorate you know even if you've never seen one of these little C elegans probably most of you haven't seen one you can tell they're old isn't that interesting so there's something about aging that's kind of universal and now here is the Deaf two mutants one gene is changed out of 20,000 and look at it it's the same age but it's it's not in the nursing home it's going skiing so its aging actually this is what's really cool its aging more slowly it takes us worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day and when I tell people about this they tend to think of maybe a 90 or 80 or 90 year old person who looks really good for being 90 or 80 but it's really more like this suppose here let's say you're a 30 year old guy or 30 in your 30s and you're you're a bachelor and you're dating people and you meet someone that you really like you get to know her and you're in a restaurant and you say well how old are you she says I'm 60 that's what it's like and you would never know you would never know until she told you okay so so what is the death to gene well as you know genes which are part of the DNA there are instructions to make a protein that does something and the Deaf to gene encodes a hormone receptor so what you see in the picture there is a cell with the hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell so part of it it's like a baseball glove part of its on the outside and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell okay so what is the def 2 receptor telling the inside of the cell I just told you that if you make a mutation in the deaf to gene said that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well the animal lives longer so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging that's what that arrow means it speeds up aging it makes it go faster so it's like the animal has the Grim Reaper inside of itself speeding up aging okay so this is a really all together really really interesting it says that on aging is subject to control by the genes and specifically by hormones so what kind of hormones are these are lots of hormones there's testosterone adrenaline you know about a lot of them these hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies the deaf to hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for hormone insulin and igf-1 now you've all heard of at least insulin insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth so these functions were known for these hormones for a long time but our studies suggested that maybe they have a third function that nobody knew about maybe they also affect aging and it's looking like that's the case so after we found made our discoveries with little C elegans people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking if we make the same deaf to mutation the hormone receptor mutation in other animals will they live longer and that is the case then flies if you change this hormone pathway and flies they live longer and also in Mice and mice are mammals like us so it's an ancient pathway because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution so the touch that still works in all these animals and they also the common precursor also gave rise to people so maybe it's working in people the same way and there are hints of this so for example there's one study that was done in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City and just like any population most of the people you know will live to about 70 or 80 but some lived to be 90 or 100 and what they found was that there were people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have deaf to mutations that has changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf-1 and these changes made the gene act may the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted they damage the gene okay so those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of these hormones for aging so the next question of course is is there any effect on age-related disease as you age you're much more likely to get cancer elsa murmurs disease heart disease all sorts of diseases it turns out that these long live mutants are more resistant to all these diseases they hardly get cancer and when they do it's not as severe so it's really interesting and it makes sense in a way that they're they're still young so why would they be getting diseases of aging until they're old so it suggests that if we could you know have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging how could that work well it turns out that in the deaf to mutants a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues and to repair damage and the way that they are switched on is by a gene regulator protein called Fox oh so when adapt to mutant you see that I have the X drawn here to the receptor the receptor isn't working as well under those conditions the Fox out protein in Blue has gone into the nucleus that little compartment there in the middle of the cell and it's sitting down at a gene binding to it where you see one gene there lots of genes actually that by now Fox oh and it's just sitting on one of them so Fox though turns on a lot of jeans and the genes that turns on includes antioxidant jeans jeans I call caregiver genes whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well to fold correctly and function correctly and it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they're damaged DNA repair genes are more active in these animals and the immune system is more active and many of these different genes we've shown actually contribute to the long lifespan of the deaf to mutant so it's really interesting these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do they have the ability to protect themselves for many kinds of damage which we think makes them live longer so what about the normal worm well when the deaf to receptor is active then it's triggers a series of events that prevent foxo from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is so it can't return the jeans on that's how it works that's why we don't see the long life spin until we have the deaf to mutant but what good is this for the worm well we think that the insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions and the good times when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment then they promote the uptake of nutrients you can store the food use it for energy grow etc but always think is that under conditions of stress the levels of these hormones drop for example having limited food supply and that we think is registered by the animal as a danger signal a signal that things are not okay and that it should roll out its protective capacity so it activates Fox oh so goes to the DNA and that triggers the expression of these genes that improve the ability of the cell to protect itself and repair itself and that's why we think the animals live longer so you can think of foxo as being like a building superintendent so maybe he's a little bit lazy but he's there he's taking care of the building but it's deteriorating and then suddenly he learned that there's going to be a hurricane so he doesn't actually do anything himself he gets on the on the telephone just like Fox Oh gets on the DNA and he calls up you know the roofer the window person the painter the floor person they all come and they fortify the house and then the hurricane comes through and the house is in much better condition than would normally have been in and not only that it can also just last longer even if there isn't a hurricane so that's that's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists now the really cool thing about växjö is that there are different forms of it we all have foxo genes but we don't all have the same so exactly the same form of the Fox Oh gene just like we all have eyes but we still of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes and there are certain forms of the Fox though gene that have been found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 and that's the case all over the world as you can see from these stars in each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked okay are there differences in the type of foxo genes among people who live really long time and there are we don't know the details of how this works but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people and that means that maybe if we tweak it a little bit we can we can increase the health and longevity of people so this is really exciting to me a fox 0 is a protein that we found in these little round worms to affect lifespan and here it affects lifespan in people so we've been trying in our lab now to develop drugs that will activate this human this fox so cell using human cells now in order to try to come up with drugs that will delay aging and age-related diseases and I'm really optimistic that this is going to work there are now lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging and for at least one of them there is a drug there's one called tour which is another nutrient sensor like the insulin pathway and mutations that damage the tour gene just like the Deaf two mutations extend lifespan and worms and flies and mice but in this case there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the tour protein and inhibits its activity and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse even when it's pretty old like age 64 a human we've got old for a mouse if you give the mouse rapamycin it will live longer now I don't want your all to go out taking rapamycin it is a drug for people but the reason is that it's it suppresses the immune system so people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected so this may not be the perfect drug for staying young longer but still here in the Year 2011 there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age that will extend their lifespan which comes out of this science that's been done in all these different animals so I'm really optimistic and I think that it won't be too long I hope before this age-old dream begins to come true thank you Thank You Cynthia um let me get this straight although you're looking for a drug that could solve Aging in in sort of old men like me what you could do now pretty well in the lab if you are allowed Ithaca Lee is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ah so should you said the kinds of drugs I was talking about would not change the genes they would just bind to the protein itself and make it change its activity so if you stop taking the drug the protein would go back to normal you could change the genes in principle there isn't the technology for a human to do that but I don't think that's a good idea and the reason is that these these hormones like the insulin and the igf-1 hormones and a tour pathway they're essential if you knock them out completely then you're very sick so it might be that you would just have to fine-tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any any problems and I think that's much better that kind of control it would be much better right right drug and also there are other ways of activating so that don't even involve insulin or igf-1 that might even be safer right so there's I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it but Tim well um what about there's a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about which is negligible senescence there are some creatures on this planet already that don't really do aging just move to one side for us if you would and there are there are some animals that don't seem to age for assembly are some turtles called our tortoises called Blandings turtles and they they grow to be odd this size and they've been tagged and they've been found to be 70 years old and when you look at these 70 year old Turtles you can't tell the difference just by looking between those turtles and 20 year old Turtles and the 70 years old ones actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places and they also have more progeny every year so and there are other examples of these kinds of animals that like turns you know certain kinds of birds are like this and nobody knows if they really can live forever or what keeps them from aging it's not clear if you get um if you look at birds which live a long time that cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide things like that and our long live mutants are too they are more resistant to these kinds of stresses so it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about which are set to run really quickly in the worm or has it have a different normal set point in in something like a bird so that a bird can live a lot longer and maybe they are set really even differently in animals with no senescence at all but we don't know but what you're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death so much as extending human youths palace that's right it's more like say if you were a dog you notice that you're getting old and you look at your human and you think why isn't this human getting old they're not getting old and in the dog's life span it's more like that but now where the human looking at looking out and imagining a different human all right thank you very much indeed since again"
The historic women’s suffrage march on Washington - Michelle Mehrtens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KhYRqozTDE,"On March 3, 1913, protesters parted for the woman in white: dressed in a flowing cape and  sitting astride a white horse, the activist Inez Milholland was  hard to miss. She was riding at the helm of the  Women’s Suffrage Parade- the first mass protest for a woman’s  right to vote on a national scale. After months of strategic planning  and controversy, thousands of women gathered  in Washington D.C. Here, they called for a constitutional  amendment granting them the right to vote. By 1913, women’s rights activists had  been campaigning for decades. As a disenfranchised group, women had no voice in the laws that  affected their– or anyone else’s– lives. However, they were struggling to secure  broader support for political equality. They’d achieved no major victories  since 1896, when Utah and Idaho enfranchised women. That brought the total number of states which recognized a women’s right to vote to four. A new, media-savvy spirit arrived  in the form of Alice Paul. She was inspired by the British  suffragettes, who went on hunger strikes and endured imprisonment in the early 1900s. Rather than conduct costly campaigns  on a state-by-state basis, Paul sought the long-lasting impact  of a constitutional amendment, which would protect women’s voting  rights nationwide. As a member of the National American  Women Suffrage Association, Paul proposed a massive pageant to whip  up support and rejuvenate the movement. Washington authorities initially  rejected her plan- and then tried to relegate the march  to side streets. But Paul got those decisions overturned and confirmed a parade for the day  before the presidential inauguration of Woodrow Wilson. This would maximize media coverage and grab the attention of the  crowds who would be in town. However, in planning the parade, Paul mainly focused on appealing to  white women from all backgrounds, including those who were racist. She actively discouraged African  American activists and organizations from participating- and stated that those who did so  should march in the back. But black women would not be  made invisible in a national movement they helped shape. On the day of the march, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, a ground-breaking investigative journalist and anti-lynching advocate, refused to move to the back and  proudly marched under the Illinois banner. The co-founder of the NAACP,  Mary Church Terrell, joined the parade with the 22 founders  of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, an organization created by female  students from Howard University. In these ways and more, black women persevered  despite deep hostility from white women in the movement, and at great political and physical risk. On the day of the parade, suffragists assembled to create a  powerful exhibition. The surging sections of the procession  included international suffragists, artists, performers and business-owners. Floats came in the form of golden  chariots; an enormous Liberty Bell; and a map  of enfranchised countries. On the steps of the Treasury Building, performers acted out the historical  achievements of women to a live orchestra. The marchers carried on even as a  mob blocked the route, hurling insults and spitting at women,  tossing cigars, and physically  assaulting participants. The police did not intervene, and in the end,  over 100 women were hospitalized. Their mistreatment, widely reported  throughout the country, catapulted the parade into the public eye— and garnered suffragists greater sympathy. National newspapers lambasted the police, and Congressional hearings investigated  their actions during the parade. After the protest, the ""Women’s Journal""  declared, “Washington has been disgraced. Equal  suffrage has scored a great victory."" In this way, the march initiated a surge of support for women’s voting rights that endured in the coming years. Suffragists kept up steady pressure  on their representatives, attended rallies, and petitioned  the White House. Inez Milholland, the woman on  the white horse, campaigned constantly throughout  the United States, despite suffering from chronic  health problems. She did not live to see her efforts  come to fruition. In 1916, she collapsed while giving a  suffrage speech and died soon after. According to popular reports, her last words were, “Mr. President, how long must women  wait for liberty?” Though full voting inclusion  would take decades, in 1920, Congress ratified the  19th amendment, finally granting women the right to vote."
Why do we harvest horseshoe crab blood? - Elizabeth Cox,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgEbcQxFUu8,"During the warmer months, especially at night during the full moon, horseshoe crabs emerge  from the sea to spawn. Waiting for them are teams of lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs by the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs on the beach because that's the only place we know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs often stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells as they grow. Once they leave  these shallow waters, they don't return until they reach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't know where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional  horseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below the ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults when they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains cells called amebocytes that protect them  from infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around these invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective  immune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes are exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules from the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released when bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick if they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices we rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them before they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains that detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when bacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested  horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample, and if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've never seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection, that probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up with such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open circulatory system. This means their blood isn't contained in blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood flows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood, it can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled  ocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need such a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived  mass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth and killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced in millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to 15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having their blood harvested. And recent research suggests this number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed fewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends beyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development  destroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also killed for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that their populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab  blood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop our beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative will someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures."
How do airplanes actually fly? - Raymond Adkins,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4VHMsIuPmk,"By 1917, Albert Einstein had explained  the relationship between space and time. But, that year, he designed a flawed airplane wing. His attempt was based  on an incomplete theory of flight. Indeed, insufficient and inaccurate explanations still circulate today. So, where did Einstein go wrong? And how do planes fly? Though we don’t always think of it this way, air is a fluid medium— it’s just less dense  than liquids like water. Things that are lighter than air are buoyant within it, while heavier objects require an upward force, called lift, to stay aloft. For planes, this force is mostly generated by the wings. One especially pervasive false  description of lift is the “Longer Path”  or “Equal Transit Time” explanation. It states that air molecules traveling over the top of a curved wing cover a longer distance than those traveling underneath. For the air molecules above to reach the wing’s trailing edge in the same instance as those  that split off and went below, air must travel faster above, creating a pocket of lower pressure  that lifts the plane. This explanation has been thoroughly debunked. Air molecules floating above and below the wing don't need to meet back up. In reality, the air traveling above reaches the wing’s trailing edge much faster than the air beneath. To get a sense of how lift is actually generated, let's simulate an airplane wing in motion. As it moves forward, the wing affects the movement of the air around it. As air meets the wing’s solid surface, a thin layer sticks to the wing. This layer pulls the surrounding air with it. The air splits into pathways  above and below the wing, following the wing’s contour. As the air that’s routed above makes  its way around the nose of the wing, it experiences centripetal acceleration, the force you also feel  in a sharply turning car. The air above therefore gathers more speed than the air traveling below. This increased speed is coupled with a decrease in pressure above the wing, which pulls even more air  across the wing’s upper surface. The air flowing across the lower surface, meanwhile, experiences less of a change in direction and speed. The pressure across the wing’s  lower surface is thus higher than that above the upper surface. This pressure difference results  in the upwards force of lift. The faster the plane travels, the greater the pressure difference, and the greater that force. Once it overcomes the downward force of gravity, the plane takes off. Air flows smoothly around curved wings. But a wing’s curvature is not the cause of lift. In fact, a flat wing that’s tilted  upwards can also create lift— as long as the air bends around it, contributing to and reinforcing the pressure difference. Meanwhile, having a wing that’s too curved or steeply angled can be disastrous: the airflow above may detach  from the wing and become turbulent. This is probably what happened  with Einstein’s wing design, nicknamed “the cat’s back.” By increasing the wing’s curvature, Einstein thought it would  generate more lift. But one test pilot reported  that the plane wobbled like “a pregnant duck” in flight. Our explanation is still  a simplified description of this nuanced, complex process. Other factors, like the air that’s flowing meters beyond the wing’s surface— being swept up, then down— as well as air vortices formed at the wing’s tips, all influence lift. And, while experts agree that  the pressure difference generates lift, their explanations for how can vary. Some might emphasize the air’s behavior at the wing’s surface, others the upward force created  as the air is deflected downwards. However, there's no controversy when it comes to the math. Engineers use a set of formulas  called the Navier-Stokes equations to precisely model air’s flow  around a wing and detail how lift is generated. More than a century after Einstein’s foray into aeronautics, lift retains its reputation as a confounding concept. But when it feels like it’s all going to come crashing down, remember: it’s just the physics of fluid in motion. This video was made possible  with support from Marriott Hotels.

The science of smog - Kim Preshoff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdbBwIgq4rs,"On July 26, 1943, Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick gas that stung people's eyes and blocked out the Sun. Panicked residents believed their city had been attacked using chemical warfare. But the cloud wasn't an act of war. It was smog. A portmanteau  of smoke and fog, the word ""smog"" was coined at the beginning of the 20th century to describe the thick gray  haze that covered cities such as London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. This industrial smog was known to form when smoke from coal-burning  home stoves and factories combined with moisture in the air. But the smog behind  the LA panic was different. It was yellowish with a chemical odor. Since the city didn't burn much coal, its cause would remain a mystery until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit identified two culprits: volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. VOCs are compounds that easily become vapors and may contain elements, such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, and sulfur. Some are naturally produced  by plants and animals, but others come from manmade sources, like solvents, paints, glues, and petroleum. Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion of gas in motor vehicles releases nitrogen oxide. That's what gives this type of smog its yellowish color. VOCs and nitrogen oxide react with sunlight to produce secondary pollutants called PANs and tropospheric, or ground-level, ozone. PANs and ozone cause eye irritation and damage lung tissue. Both are key ingredients  in photochemical smog, which is what had been plaguing LA. So why does smog affect some cities but not others? Both industrial and photochemical smog combine manmade pollution with local weather and geography. London's high humidity made it a prime location for industrial smog. Photochemical smog is strongest in urban areas with calm winds and dry, warm, sunny weather. The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight provides the energy necessary to breakdown molecules that contribute to smog formation. Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA, or lying in a basin, like Beijing, are also especially vulnerable to smog since there's nowhere for it to dissipate. That's also partially due to a phenomenon known as temperature inversion, where instead of warm air  continuously rising upward, a pollution-filled layer of air remains  trapped near the Earth's surface by a slightly warmer layer above. Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore. Both forms of smog irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, exacerbate conditions like asthma and emphysema, and increase the risk  of respiratory infections like bronchitis. Smog can be especially harmful  to young children and older people and exposure in pregnant women has been linked to low birth weight and potential birth defects. Secondary pollutants found  in photochemical smog can damage and weaken crops and decrease yield, making them more susceptible to insects. Yet for decades, smog was seen as the inevitable price of civilization. Londoners had become accustomed to  the notorious pea soup fog swirling over their streets until 1952, when the Great Smog of London shut down all transportation in the city for days and caused more  than 4,000 respiratory deaths. As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956 banned burning coal in  certain areas of the city, leading to a massive reduction in smog. Similarly, regulations on vehicle  emissions and gas content in the US reduced the volatile compounds in the air and smog levels along with them. Smog remains a major problem around the world. Countries like China and Poland that depend on coal for energy experience high levels of industrial smog. Photochemical smog and airborne particles from vehicle emissions affect many rapidly developing cities, from Mexico City and Santiago to New Delhi and Tehran. Governments have tried many methods to tackle it, such as banning cars from driving for days at a time. As more than half of the world's  population crowds into cities, considering a shift to mass transit and away from fossil fuels may allow us to breathe easier."
How much does a video weigh? - Michael Stevens of Vsauce,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzQDFKY2uEI,"Bean bags are awesome. But I see a few people out there who are standing, we've got some over here, and standing takes more work than lounging. Using the Live Strong Organization's online database of weight loss resources, you can calculate that by the time I'm done with this speech, those of you who are standing will have burned 7.5 more calories than those of you who are bean-bagging it. (Laughter) Okay, here's a question, speaking of weight loss, specifically weight, this speech is live. I'm actually here in front of you guys, we're all here together. But this speech is being recorded and it will become a video that people can access all over the world on computers, mobile devices, televisions. I weight about 190 pounds. How much will the video weigh? Asking questions like that is what I do every week on my channel Vsauce. For the last two years, I have been asking really fun questions, mind-boggling questions, and approaching them as sincerely as I can, celebrating scientific concepts and scientists. And I research and write and produce and host and edit and upload and run the social media all by myself, but it's not lonely, because Vsauce has more than 2 million subscribers, and every month, my videos are seen by more than 20 million people. Yeah. (Applause) It's very exciting. I've found that asking a strange question is a great way to get people in, not just people, but fans. And fans are different than just viewers or an audience, because fans want to come back. They subscribe to you on YouTube and they want to watch everything you've made and everything you plan to make in the future because we are curious people and sparking curiosity is great bait. It's a great way to catch a human. And once you've caught them, you have this captive audience that you can, with the goal in mind of answering the question, accidentally teach a lot of things to. So, let's take a look at some of my videos. Here are eight of them. But down here in the lower-right corner, ""What Color is a Mirror?"" When people see that, it's very difficult not to click, because you think, ""Come on, are you serious? How could you possibly answer that question?"" Well, so far, 7.6 million people have watched this five-minute video about what color a mirror is. And in that episode, I answer the question and I get a chance to explain what would normally be kind of dry topics: optics, diffuse versus specular reflection, how light works, how light works on the retina, and even the etymology of color terms like white and black. Okay, spoiler alert: mirrors are not clear, they are not silvery, like they're often illustrated. Mirrors, technically speaking, are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ... green. You can demonstrate this by putting two mirrors next to each other, facing so they reflect back and forth forever. Look down that infinite reflection, and it will get dimmer, because some light is lost or absorbed every time, but it will also become greener, because green light, that is light of a wavelength that we perceive as green, is best reflected by most mirrors. Okay, so, how much does a video weigh? Well, when you stream a video onto your computer, that information is temporarily stored using electrons. And the number of electrons on your device won't actually increase or decrease. But it takes energy to store them in one place, and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein, we know that energy and mass are related. Okay, so here's the thing: let's say you're watching a YouTube video at a really nice resolution, 720p. Assuming a typical bit rate, we can figure that a minute of YouTube video is going to need to involve about 10 million electrons on your device. Plugging all those electrons and the energy it takes to hold them in the correct place for you to see the video, into that formula, we can figure out that one minute of YouTube video increases the mass of your computer by about 10 to the negative 19th grams. Written out, it looks like this. (Whistle) That's like nothing. You could call that nothing, and you wouldn't really get in trouble, because the best scales we've ever invented that we could try to use to actually to detect that change are only accurate to 10 to the negative 9th grams. So, we can't measure it, but we can, like we just did, calculate it. And that's really cool because when I was a kid, my school had two shelves of science books. That was really cool, but I read all of them within, like, two grades, and it was hard to get more books because books are heavy, you need space for them and moving books around is tougher than what we can do today. With numbers that small, I can fit thousands of books on my own little personal electronic reader. I can stream hours and hours and days and days of YouTube video without my computer ever getting measurably heavier. And as information becomes that light, it becomes a lot more democratic, meaning that more teachers and presenters and creators and viewers than ever before can be involved. Right now, on YouTube, there is an explosion of content like this happening. The three Vsauce channels are down there in the corner. But everyone else, all together, collectively, their views dwarf what I can do alone or with the people that I work with, and that is really, really exciting. It turns out that tapping into people's curiosity and responsibly answering their questions is a brilliant way to build fans and an audience and get in viewers. It's even a great way for brands and companies to build trust. So, calculating the weight of a video is kind of a funny question, but I cannot wait to see what we ask and answer next. As always, thanks for watching. (Applause)"
Why did Phillis Wheatley disappear? - Charita Gainey,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgrwWuaRuso,"In late 1775, the newly appointed  General George Washington received a poem from one  of colonial America’s most famous writers. Its verses praised  the burgeoning revolution, invoking the goddess of their new nation to aid the general’s righteous cause. But this ode to liberty wasn’t written by some aloof, aristocratic admirer. Its author was a young Black woman who’d been enslaved for over a decade. The young girl, who’d been renamed Phillis Wheatley, had arrived in the colonies on a slave ship in 1761. The ship landed in Boston, where Susanna and John Wheatley purchased Phillis to work in their house. However, for reasons that remain unclear, they also taught her to read and write. Over the following decade, Wheatley became well versed  in poetry and religious texts, eventually beginning to produce her own poems. The family published her work  in a local newspaper, and in 1771, her elegy for renowned  reverend George Whitefield captured the public’s imagination. The poem’s repetitive rhythms, dramatic religious references, and soaring spiritual language depicted how Whitefield’s sermons “inflame the soul and captivate the mind.” Wheatley ends with an arresting image of life after death, trusting that divine forces “will re-animate his dust.” This moving tribute found an audience in both the US and England. And since the piece was published  with a note identifying the author as an enslaved woman, many readers were as fascinated  with the poet as they were with the poem. In 1773, Phillis traveled to London, where her collection of “Poems  on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral” became the first book of poetry published by an African-American woman. It was filled with profound meditations on life, death, and religion, as well as Biblical  and classical references. In “A Hymn to Humanity,” Wheatley linked  these themes to her own creative growth, portraying herself as a muse  smiled upon by heavenly bodies. Unsurprisingly, Wheatley had her critics. Many white Americans believed  Black people were incapable of producing intellectual  and creative work. Thomas Jefferson wrote that her writing didn't even deserve to be called poetry, and others dismissed her as a poor imitation of another well-known poet. But many readers of the time were enamored with Wheatley's work, including prominent European writers and politicians. Many modern readers, however, might expect her work to cover a different topic: slavery. Wheatley rarely wrote directly about her experiences as an enslaved person. And her poem addressing the topic  has been criticized for suggesting she was grateful  that enslavement led her to Christianity. But it’s incredibly unlikely Wheatley  would have been able to publicly condemn slavery without serious consequences. And many readers have found a more nuanced critique hidden within her work. For example, Wheatley was a vocal supporter of American independence, writing that her “love of freedom”  came from early experiences of being kidnapped into slavery  and separated from her parents. When disparaging England’s  imperial control, she evokes imagery of an “iron chain.” And by comparing her lack of freedom to America’s lack of independence, Wheatley subtly laments her own circumstances. Thankfully, Wheatley secured her freedom after returning from London. The reasons for her emancipation aren't entirely clear, as there’s no evidence of the Wheatleys freeing other enslaved people. However, since Phillis could have remained free in London, some believe she bargained to make emancipation a condition of her return. It’s difficult to know exactly  what happened, both here and throughout the rest  of Wheatley’s life. Her proposal for a second book was never published. In 1778, she married a free  Black man named John Peters. The two are believed to have had three children, all of whom died in infancy. Their last child is thought to have died around the same time as Wheatley, and the two were buried together in an unmarked grave. While some of Wheatley’s letters survived, she never released an account of her life. So despite her tenure as perhaps  the most famous African on the planet, Wheatley’s story has been lost  to the ravages of history, like those of countless other  enslaved peoples. But her poetry lives on today— celebrating creative growth and offering spiritual sustenance."
Can you solve the magical maze riddle? - Alex Rosenthal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7O-3NeXm9g,"Today is the annual Sly Wizard Tournament featuring competitors from the wizarding world’s three greatest schools, and you’ve been entrusted with an enormous responsibility. You are to administer the tournament. First, you and you alone will determine how many events there will be and their scoring system. Then the three wizards will enter your maze and compete in your chosen events in utmost secrecy; only you and they will see what happens. The competition begins and... Wow, that was one for the record books. The winner was... wait, you have no idea. The last thing you remember was a dark wizard showing up and casting a forgetting curse. The competitors seem even more confused— each is convinced they won. This is bad. There can be no do-overs, and the last failure to declare a winner set off the first Great Wizarding War. You’ve got to figure this out— and fast. But for the life of you, you can’t remember a thing. You know you had to follow a few rules: there had to be three or more events, each with a single winner and loser. Every event used the same scoring system, where first place received more points than second, and second more than third. All points were positive integers. Maybe there’s a record somewhere... oh, of course, your scorecard. Well, that leaves something to be desired. All that you wrote down was that in Calchemy, Newt-niz won, Leib-ton took second, and that was the only time Magnificent Marigold’s Magical Macademy got third all day. Oh, and some final scores: one school got 22 points, and both of the others got 9. Why are you so bad at taking notes?! No time for self-recrimination. The wizarding world is waiting. Who won the tournament? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 At first, it may seem like there are an overwhelming number of possible scoring systems, so let's see if we can narrow our options. We can start by looking for clues in the total scores. Every event was scored the same way, so the sum of all points in the entire tournament must be a multiple of one event’s total. In other words, if there were three events that scored 3, 2, 1, which adds up to 6, the total points for the day would be 18, which is three events times 6 points. Our total is 40. So we can make a table of possibilities: one event totaling 40 points, two totaling 20, four totaling 10, and so on. We know there were at least three events, which eliminates these options, and we can also get rid of events with fewer than 6 points, because the smallest possible total is 3 plus 2 plus 1. That leaves two prospects. Let’s try to narrow those further by breaking down the possible points earned in each event: if first place received 7 points, the teams that had totals of 9 couldn’t have won an event because their total score would be 10 or more. That means the team with 22 would have to have won all four. But then their total would be 28, so we can eliminate that option. And with four events, these numbers can't be made to add up to 22. Finally, if first place got 5 points, the highest possible score  with four events would be 20, getting rid of these two as well. In fact, five events scoring 4 each could only reach 20 as well. That leaves us with just one possibility: five events each scored 5, 2, 1. There’s exactly one way to make those scores add up to 22: the winner finished first four times and second once. The scores of 9 mean one team won once and lost four times, and the other lost once and took second four times. That must be Marigold’s Macademy, whose only third place finish was Calchemy based on your note. And Leib-ton’s second place finish in Calchemy means they scored 22 and won the Sly Wizard Tournament. You have just enough evidence to prove it, keep your job, and avert war. Phew!"
The science of snowflakes - Maruša Bradač,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwGH4gulLX4,"If you ever find yourself  gazing at falling snow, why not catch a few snowflakes  on your glove and examine their shapes? You might notice  that they look symmetrical, and if you look closely, you'll see they have six sides. You could say a snowflake  is simply frozen water, but compare one  with an ice cube from the freezer, and you'll realize  they're very different things. Unlike ice cubes, formed when liquid freezes into a solid, snowflakes form when water vapor turns straight into ice. But that still doesn't explain why snowflakes have six sides. To understand that, we need to delve deeper  into the physics of water. Water is made out of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. A single water molecule  thus has ten protons and ten electrons, eight from oxygen  and one from each hydrogen atom. The two electrons  from oxygen's outer shell are shared with two electrons from both hydrogens as they bond together, and the remaining  four outer shell electrons from oxygen form two pairs. We call the bonds between these atoms covalent bonds. The pairs of electrons  are all negatively charged. Similar charges repel, so they tend to stay as far away from each other as possible. The pairs form four electron clouds, two of which are where the hydrogen and oxygen share electrons. The repulsion between the unbonded pairs is even stronger than repulsion between the shared pairs, so the two hydrogens  get pushed a little further to an angle of 104.5 degrees. The water molecule as a whole is electrically neutral, but oxygen gets  a larger share of electrons, making it slightly negative and the hydrogens slightly positive. Due to its negative charge, the oxygen in one molecule is attracted to the positive charge of the hydrogen in another molecule. And so a weak bond  between the two molecules, called a hydrogen bond, is formed. When water freezes, this bonding occurs on repeat, ultimately forming a hexagonal structure due to the angle between hydrogens and oxygen within each molecule. This is the seed of a snowflake, and it retains a hexagonal shape as it grows. As the snowflake moves through the air, water vapor molecules  stick to the six sharp edges and expand the snowflake outwards, bit by bit. A snowflake's developing shape depends on atmospheric conditions, like humidity and temperature. As a snowflake falls, changes in weather conditions can affect how it grows, and even small differences in the paths two snowflakes take will differentiate their shapes. However, since conditions at the six  sharp edges of one snowflake are similar, a symmetric snowflake can grow. Weather conditions  affect snow on the ground, as well. Warmer ground temperatures produce a wetter snow that is easier to pack because liquid water molecules help snowflakes stick to each other. Melted snow also plays a critical role in another wintry activity, skiing. Completely dry snow  is very difficult to ski on because there's too much friction between the jagged snowflakes and the ski surface. So what's happening is that as skis move, they rub the surface of the snow and warm it up, creating a thin layer of water, which helps them slide along. So technically,  it's not really snow skiing, but water skiing. But it is true that  no matter how hard you look, you're almost definitely not going to find two identical snowflakes, and that's a mystery that scientists are still trying to solve, though we know that it has to do with the many possible  branching points in snowflake formation, and the differences  in temperature and humidity, and while we wait for the answer, we can enjoy watching these tiny fractals falling from the sky."
"How to organize, add and multiply matrices - Bill Shillito",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqWCwwyeE6k,"Translator: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar By now, I'm sure you know that in just about anything you do in life, you need numbers. In particular, though, some fields don't just need a few numbers, they need lots of them. How do you keep track of all those numbers? Well, mathematicians dating back as early as ancient China came up with a way to represent arrays of many numbers at once. Nowadays we call such an array a ""matrix,"" and many of them hanging out together, ""matrices"". Matrices are everywhere. They are all around us, even now in this very room. Sorry, let's get back on track. Matrices really are everywhere, though. They are used in business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics. One reason matrices are so cool is that we can pack so much information into them and then turn a huge series of different problems into one single problem. So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work. It turns out, you can treat matrices just like regular numbers. You can add them, subtract them, even multiply them. You can't divide them, but that's a rabbit hole of its own. Adding matrices is pretty simple. All you have to do is add the corresponding entries in the order they come. So the first entries get added together, the second entries, the third, all the way down. Of course, your matrices have to be the same size, but that's pretty intuitive anyway. You can also multiply the whole matrix by a number, called a scalar. Just multiply every entry by that number. But wait, there's more! You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix. It's not like adding them, though, where you do it entry by entry. It's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Here's how it works. Let's say you have two matrices. Let's make them both two by two, meaning two rows by two columns. Write the first matrix to the left and the second matrix goes next to it and translated up a bit, kind of like we are making a table. The product we get when we multiply the matrices together will go right between them. We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along. Now, look at the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix. See how there's two numbers in each? Multiply the first number in the row by the first number in the column: 1 times 2 is 2. Now do the next ones: 3 times 3 is 9. Now add them up: 2 plus 9 is 11. Let's put that number in the top-left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it. See how that works? You can do the same thing to get the other entries. -4 plus 0 is -4. 4 plus -3 is 1. -8 plus 0 is -8. So, here's your answer. Not all that bad, is it? There's one catch, though. Just like with addition, your matrices have to be the right size. Look at these two matrices. 2 times 8 is 16. 3 times 4 is 12. 3 times wait a minute, there are no more rows in the second matrix. We ran out of room. So, these matrices can't be multiplied. The number of columns in the first matrix has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. As long as you're careful to match up your dimensions right, though, it's pretty easy. Understanding matrix multiplication is just the beginning, by the way. There's so much you can do with them. For example, let's say you want to encrypt a secret message. Let's say it's ""Math rules"". Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me. Letting numbers stand for letters, you can put the numbers in a matrix and then an encryption key in another. Multiply them together and you've got a new encoded matrix. The only way to decode the new matrix and read the message is to have the key, that second matrix. There's even a branch of mathematics that uses matrices constantly, called Linear Algebra. If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra, do it, it's pretty awesome. But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything."
How to 3D print human tissue - Taneka Jones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbn7wLN_3k,"There are currently hundreds of thousands  of people on transplant lists, waiting for critical organs like kidneys,  hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs  available to fill that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized  organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine  currently under development. We’re not able to print complex  organs just yet, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient  and waste exchange are already in our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological  cousin of 3-D printing, a technique that deposits layers of  material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object  one slice at a time. Instead of starting with metal, plastic,  or ceramic, a 3-D printer for organs and  tissues uses bioink: a printable material that  contains living cells. The bulk of many bioinks are water-rich  molecules called hydrogels. Mixed into those are  millions of living cells as well as various chemicals that  encourage cells to communicate and grow. Some bioinks include a  single type of cell, while others combine several different  kinds to produce more complex structures. Let’s say you want to print a meniscus, which is a piece of cartilage in the knee that keeps the shinbone and thighbone  from grinding against each other. It’s made up of cells called chondrocytes, and you’ll need a healthy supply of  them for your bioink. These cells can come from donors whose cell lines are replicated in a lab. Or they might originate from a  patient’s own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less likely to be rejected by their body. There are several printing techniques, and the most popular is extrusion-based  bioprinting. In this, bioink gets loaded into a  printing chamber and pushed through a round nozzle  attached to a printhead. It emerges from a nozzle that’s rarely  wider than 400 microns in diameter, and can produce a continuous filament roughly the thickness  of a human fingernail. A computerized image or file guides the  placement of the strands, either onto a flat surface or into a  liquid bath that’ll help hold the structure in place  until it stabilizes. These printers are fast, producing the  meniscus in about half an hour, one thin strand at a time. After printing, some bioinks  will stiffen immediately; others need UV light or an additional  chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure. If the printing process is successful, the cells in the synthetic tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do in real tissue: signaling to each other, exchanging  nutrients, and multiplying. We can already print relatively simple  structures like this meniscus. Bioprinted bladders have also been  successfully implanted, and printed tissue has promoted facial  nerve regeneration in rats. Researchers have created lung tissue, skin, and cartilage, as well as miniature, semi-functional  versions of kidneys, livers, and hearts. However, replicating the complex  biochemical environment of a major organ  is a steep challenge. Extrusion-based bioprinting may destroy a significant percentage of cells in the  ink if the nozzle is too small, or if the printing pressure is too high. One of the most formidable challenges is how to supply oxygen and nutrients  to all the cells in a full-size organ. That’s why the greatest successes so far have been with structures  that are flat or hollow— and why researchers are busy  developing ways to incorporate blood vessels  into bioprinted tissue. There’s tremendous potential to use  bioprinting to save lives and advance our  understanding of how our organs function  in the first place. And the technology opens up a dizzying  array of possibilities, such as printing tissues with  embedded electronics. Could we one day engineer organs that  exceed current human capability, or give ourselves features like  unburnable skin? How long might we extend human life  by printing and replacing our organs? And exactly who—and what— will have access to this technology  and its incredible output?"
Everything you need to know to read “The Canterbury Tales” - Iseult Gillespie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0ZrBr9DOwA,"A portly Miller, barely sober enough to sit on his horse, rambles on about the flighty wife  of a crotchety old carpenter and the scholar she takes as her lover. To get some time alone together, the scholar and the wife  play various tricks that involve feigning madness, staging a biblical flood, and exposing themselves in public. But the parish clerk  is also lusting after the wife, and comes by every night  to sing outside her house. This becomes so tiresome  that she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out the window  for him to kiss. When this appears not to work, her scholar decides  to try farting in the same position, but this time, the clerk  is waiting with a red-hot poker. This might all sound like a bawdy joke, but it’s part of one of the most esteemed  works of English literature ever created: The Canterbury Tales, which seamlessly blends the lofty  and the lowly. The work consists of 24 stories, each told by one  of Chaucer’s spirited characters. Narrators include  familiar Medieval figures such as a Knight, a Clerk, and a Nun, and the less recognizable Reeve, and Mancible, and others. The Tales are written in Middle English, which often looks entirely different  from the language spoken today. It was used between the 12th  and 15th centuries, and evolved from Old English due to increased contact  with European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Most of the Middle English alphabet  is still familiar today, with the inclusion  of a few archaic symbols, such as yogh, which denotes the y, j, or gh sound. The loquacious cast of the Tales  first meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark. They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury  to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett, a martyred archbishop who was murdered  in his own Cathedral. Eager and nosy for some personal details, the host of the Inn  proposes a competition: whoever tells the best tale  will be treated to dinner. If not for their pilgrimage, many of these figures would never  have had the chance to interact. This is because Medieval society followed  a feudal system that divided the clergy and nobility  from the working classes, made up of peasants and serfs. By Chaucer’s time, a professional class of merchants  and intellectuals had also emerged. Chaucer spent most of his life  as a government official during the Hundred Years' War, traveling throughout Italy and France, as well as his native England. This may have influenced the panoramic vision of his work, and in the Tales, no level of society is above mockery. Chaucer uses the quirks  of the characters’ language – the ribald humor of the Cook, the solemn prose of the Parson, and the lofty notions of the Squire – to satirize their worldviews. The varied dialects, genres,  and literary tropes also make the work a vivid record of the different ways Medieval audiences  entertained themselves. For instance, the Knight’s tale  of courtly love, chivalry, and destiny riffs on romance, while the tales of working-class narrators are generally comedies filled with scatological language, sexual deviance, and slapstick. This variation  includes something for everyone, and that’s one reason why readers continue to delight in the work in both Middle English and translation. While the narrative runs  to over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the prologue ambitiously  introduces 29 pilgrims and promises four stories apiece, and the innkeeper never crowns a victor. It’s possible that Chaucer was so caught up in his sumptuous creations that he delayed picking a winner - or perhaps he was so fond  of each character that he just couldn’t choose. Whatever the reason, this means that every reader is free to judge; the question of who wins is up to you."
Can you still feel a limb that's gone? - Joshua W. Pate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdihphPp1Q0,"The vast majority of people  who’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape, but in complete lifelike detail. They can flex their phantom fingers and sometimes even feel  the chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail. And astonishingly enough, occasionally even people born  without a limb can feel a phantom. So what causes phantom limb sensations? The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map  of the body in our brains. And the fact that it’s possible for someone who’s never had a limb  to feel one implies we are born with at least  the beginnings of this map. But one thing sets the phantoms that appear after amputation apart from their flesh  and blood predecessors: the vast majority of them are painful. To fully understand phantom limbs  and phantom pain, we have to consider the entire pathway  from limb to brain. Our limbs are full of sensory neurons responsible for everything from the textures we feel  with our fingertips to our understanding  of where our bodies are in space. Neural pathways carry this sensory input through the spinal cord and up to the brain. Since so much of this path  lies outside the limb itself, most of it remains  behind after an amputation. But the loss of a limb alters the way signals travel  at every step of the pathway. At the site of an amputation, severed nerve endings can thicken  and become more sensitive, transmitting distress signals  even in response to mild pressure. Under normal circumstances, these signals would be curtailed  in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. For reasons we don’t fully understand, after an amputation, there is a loss of this inhibitory control in the dorsal horn, and signals can intensify. Once they pass through the spinal cord, sensory signals reach the brain. There, the somatosensory cortex  processes them. The entire body is mapped in this cortex. Sensitive body parts  with many nerve endings, like the lips and hands, are represented by the largest areas. The cortical homunculus is a model  of the human body with proportions based on the size of each body part’s representation in the cortex, The amount of cortex devoted  to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input  the brain receives from that body part. For example, representation of the left hand is larger in violinists than in non-violinists. The brain also increases  cortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensations  that alert us to danger. This increased representation  can lead to phantom pain. The cortical map is also  most likely responsible for the feeling of body parts  that are no longer there, because they still  have representation in the brain. Over time, this representation may shrink and the phantom limb may shrink with it. But phantom limb sensations  don’t necessarily disappear on their own. Treatment for phantom pain  usually requires a combination of physical therapy, medications for pain management, prosthetics, and time. A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing  the range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb. The patient places the phantom limb  into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb  in front of the mirror. This tricks the brain  into seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it. Scientists are developing  virtual reality treatments that make the experience  of mirror box therapy even more lifelike. Prosthetics can also  create a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove  their prosthetics at night. And phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize prosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively. There are still many questions  about phantom limbs. We don’t know why some amputees escape the pain typically associated  with these apparitions, or why some don’t have phantoms at all. And further research into phantom limbs isn’t just applicable to the people  who experience them. A deeper understanding  of these apparitions will give us insight into the work our brains do every day to build the world as we perceive it. They’re an important reminder that the realities we experience are, in fact, subjective."
