"Healthier men, one moustache at a time - Adam Garone",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D4Mmr2E7hM,"  I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon  our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank  you"
Can you solve the famously difficult green-eyed logic puzzle? - Alex Gendler,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98TQv5IAtY8,"Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians, are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There's no escape, except for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes,  they'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed  into the volcano. As it happens,  all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured they can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed  to communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other during each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure  from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them  any new information. What can you say  to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd,  ""At least one of you has green eyes."" The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement couldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island seems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning  after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave the previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount of prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things by imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know,  that could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other  still there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement  could only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes  the same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his or her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning,  they're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see  two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning,  they still can't be sure. Carl thinks, ""If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just  watching each other, and will now both leave  on the second night."" But when he sees both  of them the third morning, he realizes they must  have been watching him, too. Adria and Bill have each  been going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night. Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat no matter how many prisoners you add. The key is the concept  of common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis. The new information was not contained in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone  simultaneously. Now, besides knowing at least one of them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows  that everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them  also knows this, and so on. What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one of the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed as the number of prisoners on the island. Of course, you could have spared the prisoners 98 days on the island by telling them at least 99 of you have green eyes, but when mad dictators are involved, you're best off with a good headstart."
The genius of Mendeleev's periodic table - Lou Serico,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPnwBITSmgU,"Translator: tom carter Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich -- and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, ""eka"" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963. There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back."
What is an aurora? - Michael Molina,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czMh3BnHFHQ,"Every second, one million tons of matter is blasted from the Sun at the velocity of one million miles per hour, and it's on a collision course with Earth! But don't worry, this isn't the opening of a new Michael Bay movie. This is The Journey of the Polar Lights. The northern and southern lights, also known as the aurora Borealis and aurora Australis, respectively, occur when high energy particles from the Sun collide with neutral atoms in our atmosphere. The energy emitted from this crash produces a spectacle of light that mankind has marveled at for centuries. But the particles' journey isn't just as simple as leaving the Sun and arriving at Earth. Like any cross-country road trip, there's a big detour and nobody asks for directions. Let's track this intergalactic voyage by focusing on three main points of their journey: leaving the Sun, making a pit stop in the Earth's magnetic fields, and arriving at the atmosphere above our heads. The protons and electrons creating the northern lights depart from the Sun's corona. The corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere and is one of the hottest regions. Its intense heat causes the Sun's hydrogen and helium atoms to vibrate and shake off protons and electrons as if they were stripping off layers on a hot, sunny day. Impatient and finally behind the wheel, these free protons and electrons move too fast to be contained by the Sun's gravity and group together as plasma, an electrically charged gas. They travel away from the Sun as a constant gale of plasma, known as the solar wind. However, the Earth prevents the solar wind from traveling straight into the planet by setting up a detour, the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is formed by the Earth's magnetic currents and shields our planet from the solar winds by sending out the particles around the Earth. Their opportunity to continue the journey down to the atmosphere comes when the magnetosphere is overwhelmed by a new wave of travelers. This event is coronal mass ejection, and it occurs when the Sun shoots out a massive ball of plasma into the solar wind. When one of these coronal mass ejections collides with Earth, it overpowers the magnetosphere and creates a magnetic storm. The heavy storm stresses the magnetosphere until it suddenly snaps back, like and overstretched elastic band, flinging some of the detoured particles towards Earth. The retracting band of the magnetic field drags them down to the aurora ovals, which are the locations of the northern and southern lights. After traveling 93 million miles across the galaxy, the Sun's particles finally produce their dazzling light show with the help of some friends. 20 to 200 miles above the surface, the electrons and protons meet up with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and they sure are happy to see each other. The Sun's particles high five the atoms, giving their energy to the Earth's neutral oxygen and nitrogen atoms. When the atoms in the atmosphere are contacted by the particles, they get excited and emit photons. Photons are small bursts of energy in the form of light. The colors that appear in the sky depend on the wavelength of the atom's photon. Excited oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colors, whereas excited nitrogen atoms produce blue and deep red hues. The collection of these interactions is what creates the northern and southern lights. The polar lights are best seen on clear nights in regions close to magnetic north and south poles. Nighttime is ideal because the Aurora is much dimmer than sunlight and cannot be seen in daytime. Remember to look up at the sky and read up on the Sun's energy patterns, specifically sunspots and solar flares, as these will be good guides for predicting the auroras."
The sibling rivalry that divided a town - Jay Van Bavel and Dominic Packer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNUQ8RnuUFk,"In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected  their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and  marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became  known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down  to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant  cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn  to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators  at the University of Bristol. This team developed  the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required  to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants  without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic,  gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things correctly or incorrectly; but in reality,  the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources to distribute. Each participant was free to give resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources they personally would receive. With all the ingredients  for discrimination removed and no reason for competition over resources, the scientists assumed this would make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined  by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them” were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes,  resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people  showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel  and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership  to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link  that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have  been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense  of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together  in a new group can temporarily help people overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible."
Animation basics: Homemade special effects - TED-Ed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dq-3JfRrgRM,"Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Jessica Ruby How do you get from point A to point B? Why not spice it up with homemade special effects? A film is simply a series of images played in sequence to create the illusion of motion. If you manipulate those images, crazy things can happen. We used a tablet and one of the many stop motion apps out there. How do you get from point A to point B? We started off by taking a bunch of pictures of Celeste in place. Then, just like stop motion animation, the character is moved just a bit before the next picture is taken, which, in this case, creates a sliding effect. Here we use the oldest trick in the book. By alternating between photos of Celeste on-screen and off-screen, we've made her childhood dream of teleportation a reality. With a little creativity, there are a million ways you can used homemade special effects to make something as simple as getting from point A to point B much more fun. If you're at a loss for ideas, try finding inspiration in your surroundings, like the refrigerator and your coat rack. You can even try incorporating everyday objects from around your house, like, say, umbrellas or binder clips. Wherever there is an object, there is an opportunity to make it come to life. When humans are used in stop motion animation, that's called pixilation, a term coined in the mid-twentieth century, well before the word pixel was a part of our vocabulary. But these sorts of special effects are as old as the art of film making, and thanks to today's technologies, can be reproduced in your very own kitchen. Moving an object from point A to point B is a fundamental principle of animation. To learn more about the process and the tools we used, visit the ""Dig Deeper"" section on ed.ted.com."
What makes a poem … a poem? - Melissa Kovacs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwhouCNq-Fc,"Muhammad Ali spent years training to become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create the shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's  graduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished,  the audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered the shortest poem ever. ""Me, we."" Or is it ""me, weeee""? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem, then what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled with this question, often using metaphors to approximate a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain recognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's musical qualities. This can be achieved through rhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water wrung out of it. Three - poems often feature intense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's ""Ode to an Onion."" Poetry, like art itself, has a way of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns  of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's ""silencio"" toe the line between visual art and poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems whose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness of a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry faded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people love to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets in a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme, rhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. ""I can hear sweat trickling  down your cheek Your heartbeat sound  like Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete."" So far, all the examples we've seen have had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape  that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted updates from the earthquake in Haiti. ""Was in b-room getting dressed when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing."" Smith uses language in a way that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form  that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five,  seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry,  prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis, which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted  through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence  in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed 100% of the time."
What if cracks in concrete could fix themselves? - Congrui Jin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znSeL66e8qE,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life."
Could your language affect your ability to save money? - Keith Chen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUJuYDPXjus, so the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics dating back to at least before adam smith and that is why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior now many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this what i'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save let me tell you a little bit about savings rights a little bit about language and then i'll draw that i'll draw that connection let's start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd or the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd countries by and large you should think about these as the richest most industrialized countries in the world and by joining the oecd they were affirming a common commitment to democracy open markets and free trade despite all of these similarities we see huge differences in savings behavior so all the way over on the left of this graph what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdps per year holding down the right flank of the oecd all the way on the other side is greece and what you can see is that over the last 25 years greece has barely managed to save more than 10 of their gdp it should be noted of course that the united states and the uk are the next in line now that we see these huge differences in savings rights how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ linguist and cognitive scientists have been have been exploring this question for for many years now and then i'll draw the connection between these two behaviors many of you have probably already noticed that i'm chinese i grew up in the uh the midwest of the united states and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and in fact uh more fundamentally than that every so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways now how might that be let me give you an example suppose i were i were talking with you and i was introducing you to my uncle okay you understood exactly what i just said in english if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other though i wouldn't have that luxury all right i wouldn't have been able to convey so little information what my language would have forced me to do instead of just telling you this is my uncle is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth and if this man was my father's brother whether he was older than or younger than my father all of this information is obligatory chinese doesn't let me ignore it and in fact if i want to speak correctly chinese forces me to constantly think about it now uh that fascinated me endlessly as a child but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time so for example if i'm speaking in english i have to speak grammatically differently if i'm talking about past rain it rained yesterday current rain it is raining now or future rain it will rain tomorrow notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events why because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i'm saying to say it will rain it's or it's going to rain it's simply not permissible in english to say it rain tomorrow in contrast to that that's almost exactly what you would say in chinese a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker's ears they can say yesterday it rained now it rain tomorrow would rain in some deep sense chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that english forces us to constantly do uh in order to speak correctly is this difference in languages only between very very distantly related languages like english and chinese actually no so many of you know in this room that english is a germanic language what you may not have realized is that english is actually an outlier it is the only germanic language that requires this for example most other germanic language speakers feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow by saying morgan regnetas quite literally to an english ear it rained tomorrow this led me to as a behavioral economist to an intriguing hypothesis could how you speak about time could how your language forces you to think about time affect your propensity to behave across time you speak english a future language and what that means is that every time you discuss the future or any kind of a future event grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly disassociate the future from the present every time you speak if that's true and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present that's going to make it harder to save if on the other hand you speak a futureless language the present and the future you speak about them identically if that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically that's going to make it easier to save now this is a fanciful theory you know i'm a professor i get paid to have fanciful theories um but how would you actually go about testing such a theory well what i did with n was to access the linguistics literature and and interestingly enough there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world this is a pocket of futureless language speakers in northern europe interestingly enough when you start to crank the data these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be by and large some of the world's best savers just to give you a hint of that let's look back at that oecd graph that we were talking about once you see these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak future languages what is the average difference here five percentage points of your gdp saved per year over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation now while these findings are suggestive countries can be different in so many different ways that it's very very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences what i'm going to show you though is something that i've been engaging in for a year which is trying to gather all of the largest data sets that we have access to our as economists and i'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences hoping to get this relationship to break all right and just in summary no matter how far i push this i can't get it to break let me show you how far you can do that one way to imagine that is i gather large data sets from around the world so for example there's the survey of health and retirement in europe from this data set you actually learn that retired european families are extremely patient with survey takers so so imagine that you're a retired household in belgium someone comes to your front door excuse me uh would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio do you happen to know how much your house is worth you mind telling me would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long if you do would you mind i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway um would you mind squeezing as hard as you can in your dominant hand this device so i can measure your grip strength how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity right this survey takes over a day combine that okay with the demographic and health survey collected by usaid in developing countries in africa for example where which that survey actually can go so far as to measure the directly measure the hiv status of families living in for example rural nigeria combine that with the world value survey which measures the political opinions uh unfortunately for me the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world take all of that data combine it and this map is what you get what you find is nine countries around the world that have significant native populations which speak both futureless and future languages and what i'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure okay and then i'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels what are the characteristics we can control for well i'm going to match families on country of birth and resonance the demographics what sex their age their income level within their own country their educational achievement a lot about their family structure it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe and most granularly i break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world so an extreme level of granularity uh there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself okay now uh effectively everything i'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families it's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo now even after all of this granular level of control do futureless language speakers seem to save more yes futures language speakers even after this level of control are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year does this have cumulative effects yes by the time they retire futures language speakers holding constant their income are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings can we push this data even further yes because i just told you we actually collect a lot of health data as economists now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings well think about smoking for example smoking is in some deep sense negative savings right if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure smoking is just the opposite it's current pleasure in exchange for future pain what we should expect then is the opposite effect and that's exactly what we find futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 less likely to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families and they're going to be 13 to 70 percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire and they're going to report being 21 more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter i could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find it's almost impossible not to find a a savings behavior for which the this strong effect isn't present my linguistics and economics colleagues at yale and i are just starting to do this work and uh really explore and understand the ways that these that these subtle nudges cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak ultimately the goal once we understand how these subtle effects uh can change our decision making we want to be able to kind of provide people tools so that they can consciously make themselves better savers and more conscious investors in their own future thank you very much  you
